        "No, after your program end date has passed, OGS is no longer able to extend your program. If you believe that you will need a program extension, please make sure that you apply with OGS well in advance. Not extending before your program end date will result in you losing valid F or J status and require corrective action at considerable expense to a student and potential loss of F-1 or J-1 benefits.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer 1: Thank you for reaching out! I'm so sorry to hear that your application was rejected and returned to you. Firstly, please do not mail the application yet. It's essential to contact OGS and make an appointment with an OGS advisor to discuss your situation further. They will guide you on the next steps to take. It's important to note that if there is any chance your I-20 with Pre-Completion OPT recommendation will be more than 30 days old when it is received by the USCIS, it will result in a denial. Therefore, it's crucial to act quickly and follow the instructions provided by OGS to avoid any further complications. Again, I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, and I hope you get the support you need from OGS. Please let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer 2: Yes, you can request for your application to be expedited by USCIS. Although USCIS generally does not accept expedite processing, you may try including a job offer letter and a cover letter explaining your job is expected to start on a certain day and send them along with the required documents for the Post-Completion OPT application. If you already have submitted the application to USCIS, you may call customer service and ask how to request the expedite processing. However, there is no guarantee that USCIS will honor your request. It is solely your responsibility to prepare the documents and submit the expedite request.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer 3: I apologize, but according to federal regulations, U.S. students taking a non-medical leave of absence must spend the duration of their absence outside of the U.S. I recommend consulting with OGS to discuss your options and ensure compliance with immigration regulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer 4: Hello! Thank you for reaching out to OGS with your question. If you need to return home during a required term, you should be aware that the maximum amount of time you can be outside of the U.S. is 5 months. After 5 months, you will need to obtain a new Initial I-20 document to return to the U.S. This will reset your eligibility requirements for CPT/OPT. Please refer to the OGS website for more information on the five-month rule and the process for obtaining a new Initial I-20. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact OGS.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer 5:\n",
        "To start a new job, you typically need to have a Social Security Number (SSN). However, the SSA is only able to process your SSN application up to 30 days prior to your employment start date. Therefore, it is recommended that you apply for an SSN as soon as possible, but no earlier than 30 days before your employment start date. If you have not received your SSN by the time you start working, you may need to provide alternative forms of identification to your employer. Please consult with your employer and the Office of Global Services (OGS) for more information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer 6: Yes, if you don’t need a full-time course load to complete your program, you can still be less than full-time in your final term even if you received a reduced course load prior to your final term. However, it is essential to confirm with your academic advisor that all graduation requirements have been met. Please refer to the Final Term page for more information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer 7: Hello! Thank you for reaching out. The NU guard.me insurance policy provides coverage for students and their accompanying family members for a maximum of 2 years from the date of purchase. Please note that you will need to extend your policy before the expiry date to maintain coverage. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer 8:\n",
        "You may be eligible to obtain a Northeastern DS-2019 as a transfer student; however, the U.S. institution from where you are transferring out has to process your transfer request before the completion date of your current program at that institution. The area of study for your transfer program at Northeastern must be the same as your area of study at your current institution. You will need to work with your current institution's international student office in order to follow the transfer out process and you will also need to work with OGS for the transfer in process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer 9: Yes, you can still enroll in classes during the summer term even if it is not required for you. However, please note that you must maintain full-time enrollment and appropriate on-ground presence throughout the duration of the summer term to maintain your F-1 or J-1 status. If you have any questions or concerns about your summer enrollment, please consult directly with OGS.\n",

            "['No, after your program end date has passed, OGS is no longer able to extend your program. If you believe that you will need a program extension, please make sure that you apply with OGS well in advance. Not extending before your program end date will result in you losing valid F or J status and require corrective action at considerable expense to a student and potential loss of F-1 or J-1 benefits.', \"Thank you for reaching out! I'm so sorry to hear that your application was rejected and returned to you. Firstly, please do not mail the application yet. It's essential to contact OGS and make an appointment with an OGS advisor to discuss your situation further. They will guide you on the next steps to take. It's important to note that if there is any chance your I-20 with Pre-Completion OPT recommendation will be more than 30 days old when it is received by the USCIS, it will result in a denial. Therefore, it's crucial to act quickly and follow the instructions provided by OGS to avoid any further complications. Again, I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, and I hope you get the support you need from OGS. Please let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.\", 'Yes, you can request for your application to be expedited by USCIS. Although USCIS generally does not accept expedite processing, you may try including a job offer letter and a cover letter explaining your job is expected to start on a certain day and send them along with the required documents for the Post-Completion OPT application. If you already have submitted the application to USCIS, you may call customer service and ask how to request the expedite processing. However, there is no guarantee that USCIS will honor your request. It is solely your responsibility to prepare the documents and submit the expedite request.', 'I apologize, but according to federal regulations, U.S. students taking a non-medical leave of absence must spend the duration of their absence outside of the U.S. I recommend consulting with OGS to discuss your options and ensure compliance with immigration regulations.', \"Hello! Thank you for reaching out to OGS with your question. If you need to return home during a required term, you should be aware that the maximum amount of time you can be outside of the U.S. is 5 months. After 5 months, you will need to obtain a new Initial I-20 document to return to the U.S. This will reset your eligibility requirements for CPT/OPT. Please refer to the OGS website for more information on the five-month rule and the process for obtaining a new Initial I-20. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact OGS.\", 'To start a new job, you typically need to have a Social Security Number (SSN). However, the SSA is only able to process your SSN application up to 30 days prior to your employment start date. Therefore, it is recommended that you apply for an SSN as soon as possible, but no earlier than 30 days before your employment start date. If you have not received your SSN by the time you start working, you may need to provide alternative forms of identification to your employer. Please consult with your employer and the Office of Global Services (OGS) for more information.', 'Yes, if you don’t need a full-time course load to complete your program, you can still be less than full-time in your final term even if you received a reduced course load prior to your final term. However, it is essential to confirm with your academic advisor that all graduation requirements have been met. Please refer to the Final Term page for more information.', 'Hello! Thank you for reaching out. The NU guard.me insurance policy provides coverage for students and their accompanying family members for a maximum of 2 years from the date of purchase. Please note that you will need to extend your policy before the expiry date to maintain coverage. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.', \"You may be eligible to obtain a Northeastern DS-2019 as a transfer student; however, the U.S. institution from where you are transferring out has to process your transfer request before the completion date of your current program at that institution. The area of study for your transfer program at Northeastern must be the same as your area of study at your current institution. You will need to work with your current institution's international student office in order to follow the transfer out process and you will also need to work with OGS for the transfer in process.\", 'Yes, you can still enroll in classes during the summer term even if it is not required for you. However, please note that you must maintain full-time enrollment and appropriate on-ground presence throughout the duration of the summer term to maintain your F-1 or J-1 status. If you have any questions or concerns about your summer enrollment, please consult directly with OGS.']\n"
