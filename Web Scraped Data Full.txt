What is an I-20?

An I-20 is a U.S. immigration document issued by a university to certify that an F-1 student has met admission requirements and has proof of sufficient financial resources for his/her studies. An I-20 is required to apply for an F-1 student visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad.
Newly admitted international students that have paid a deposit should request an I-20. The Office of Global Services (OGS) encourages you to submit your initial I-20 request as soon as possible because the visa process takes time.

Who is an Initial student?

New international students coming from outside the U.S. that are seeking F-1 visa status.

Who is a Transfer Student?

If a student currently has an Active Student and Exchange Visitor System (SEVIS) record with another SEVP-certified institution in the U.S., they may be eligible to transfer their SEVIS record to Northeastern University. Transfer students must:

Request to have their SEVIS record transferred out from their current institution to Northeastern University
Apply for a Transfer I-20 from Northeastern University

Please see the Requesting your Transfer-In I-20 page for more information.

Who is a Change of Status student?

If you are currently in the U.S. in a non-immigrant status (B-1/B-2, F-1, F-2, H-1b or H-4) and would like to change to a different non-immigrant status (F-1, F-2, J-1 or J-2), you must apply for a Change of Status I-20. Once you’ve received the Change of Status I-20 there are two options:

Option 1: You may travel outside of the U.S., apply for a visa at a U.S. Embassy with all required materials, and re-enter the U.S. in the new status. This option is often referred to as Consular Processing.
Option 2: You may apply to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to change your status without leaving the U.S. by completing Form I-539 Application to extend/change your non-immigrant status. This process can take between 6 and 9 months and it is recommended you do not travel while your application is in process.

Please note: If your change of status application is approved by USCIS (option 2), your new F/J status will be active; however, you will not receive a corresponding visa in your passport that reflects the new status. As a result, you will need to apply for a new visa stamp at an embassy/consulate outside of the U.S. in order to re-enter the U.S. in F/J status.
To learn more about change of status and see which option is best for you, please schedule an appointment with an advisor at the Office of Global Services (OGS) by calling +1-617-373-2310.
Video: Change to F-1 Student Status
Video: Change to F-1 Student Status within the U.S.

TRAVELING WITH A PENDING CHANGE OF STATUS
We don’t recommend traveling outside of the U.S. while your application with USCIS is still pending. If you can’t avoid traveling, please consult with OGS beforehand as you may need to reach out to USCIS to withdraw your application prior to traveling and submit a new I-20 request with OGS.
CURRICULAR PRACTICAL TRAINING (CPT) AND OPTIONAL PRACTICAL TRAINING (OPT)
In order to be eligible for both CPT and OPT, you must have maintained full time enrollment with appropriate on-ground presence for at least one academic year. One academic year is defined as two semesters or three quarters. It may be possible for you to use your time in another status towards meeting the one academic year.
If you are a change of status student and have questions about CPT/OPT eligibility, please call OGS to schedule an appointment with an advisor by calling +1-617-373-2310.

What is a Change of Degree Level?

If you are a current, continuing student at Northeastern and you will be starting a new program at Northeastern, you must submit a Change of Degree Level e-form request to myOGS prior to starting the new program.
Please see the Guidelines on Maintaining Status page for more information.

When is the I-20 request deadline for my initial I-20?

Please refer to the suggested deadlines listed on the Requesting your I-20 page.

How long does it take for the Initial I-20 to be issued?

The process of issuing the I-20 can take approximately 15 business days to complete. Please be aware that during the peak season, it may take longer.  If there are missing parts of the application, OGS will contact you to correct and resubmit your request.

How do I access myOGS?

After your admission to Northeastern, the admissions team from the college or school you have been admitted to will send you a link to claim your Student Hub account. Once you claim your Student Hub account, your myOGS account will be created within 24-48 hours and you will be able to access the links to make a request within the portal.

Why am I unable to access the I-20 request?

You are required to confirm your enrollment first by following the instructions on your official decision letter, which may include arranging to pay (e.g. by credit card) an enrollment deposit. This transaction is required of all admitted students before they can initiate the I-20 process.
Most students can login to their application account/official decision letter using one of the following links:

College of Professional Studies programs application link.
D’Amore-McKim School of Business programs application link.
Most other graduate programs application link.

If you have questions about confirming your enrollment, please contact the admissions department for your program or college.
If you are still unable to access the I-20 request after confirming your enrollment, please contact OGS at through the OGS Service Portal or by calling +1.617.373.2310

How much money do I need to show for I-20 issuance?

You need to show that you can cover the expenses for the first academic year including but not limited to, tuition, fees, health insurance coverage, and living expenses. Please refer to the I-20 instruction information for the exact total amount for your program

I have a financial document but I am not sure if it’s acceptable for I-20 issuance. What should I do?

Please refer to the “Guidelines for Demonstrating Financial Support” on the I-20 Instructions.

I am an incoming PhD student that received Stipended Graduate Assistantships (SGA) from my academic department with an amount that can also cover my spouse. Can I show my SGA letter as a financial document for both of our I-20s?

Yes, you can provide your SGA letter as a financial document.

I will be coming with my spouse/child to the U.S. When should I request their I-20 and how much extra do I need to show for their I-20s?

If you are planning to arrive together, you should request both/all of the I-20s at the same time.
You will need to show $10,000 in additional funds for your spouse and $6,000 for your child.

How will I receive my I-20?

OGS will email an electronically signed, password-protected PDF version of your I-20 to your Northeastern email. We strongly recommend opening your I-20 document immediately to avoid any last-minute problems with the document or access to the document. If you have any questions regarding your I-20 or are unable to open the PDF, please contact OGS as soon as possible during business hours.
You may download your I-20 to your phone or computer, or print your I-20. If you are printing your I-20, please use a high quality, colored printer.

These dates can be confirmed by locating the earliest admission date and program start date on your I-20.

My initial I-20 does not have a travel signature and I will be entering the U.S. for the first time. Will I be able to enter the U.S.?

You do not need to have a travel signature when you enter the U.S. for the first time on your Initial I-20.
Who is a transfer student?

If a student currently has an Active Student and Exchange Visitor System (SEVIS) record with another SEVP-certified institution in the U.S., they may be eligible to transfer their SEVIS record to Northeastern University. Transfer students must:

Request to have their SEVIS record transferred out from their current institution to Northeastern University
Apply for a Transfer I-20 from Northeastern University

Transferring your record

It is important that you work with the Designated School Official (DSO) at your current school’s international office on the specific process and required documentation needed to complete your transfer-out request. As your current school holds your SEVIS record, you must first start the transfer process there.
After completion of the transfer out process, your current institution will set a transfer release date for your SEVIS record. This is the date that your record will be transferred to Northeastern University. In general, your transfer release date has to be within 60-days from the expiration date on your I-20.
Please be sure to confirm with your current school that your record will be transferred to the correct campus at Northeastern. Campus locations include Boston, Seattle, Silicon Valley, Oakland, Arlington, Portland and Charlotte.
Your I-20 form from Northeastern cannot be issued until you complete the required steps of requesting a Transfer I-20 with OGS. In addition, your I-20 cannot be issued until your SEVIS record has been released by your transfer out school to Northeastern.

Applying for the transfer I-20

You can submit a Transfer I-20 request only after you have been officially admitted to a full-time program of study.  At that time, you will then be able to submit an electronic I-20 request through myOGS. OGS encourages you to submit your Transfer I-20 request as soon as possible to provide ample time for the issuance of the I-20 prior to your enrollment.

Helping Students Engage with the World

The N.U.in program is an experiential, academic program that expands students’ Northeastern education into worldwide locations. Because the first semester of the N.U.in program is spent outside the U.S., international students must read all the information to understand how this will impact their arrival to the U.S. when coming to the Boston campus in the spring term after the N.U.in program.

I-20 Form for Spring Semester

The I-20 form is a visa eligibility document issued by Northeastern University to certify that an eligible international student has met admission requirements for a full-time program of study and has demonstrated sufficient financial support for his/her studies in the U.S. This visa eligibility document is needed to apply for a nonimmigrant student visa at a U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate in order to obtain F-1 status within the U.S.
NOTE: For students who are participating in N.U.in outside the United States, the I-20 lists your January program start date. You can enter the U.S. as an F-1 student up to 30 days before this date.
Canadian and Bermudian citizens typically do not need visas to study in the U.S. However, you do need to request an I-20 and also pay the SEVIS fee.

What Type of I-20 to Request

N.U.in Outside the U.S.
New international students who will be attending the N.U.in program for Fall semester outside of the U.S., should request a new initial I-20 for the upcoming spring term. They will start the U.S. portion of their degree program in January. The I-20 form will be issued for a January start.

How to Prepare and Submit an Online Request

Required documents for the I-20 request e-form. They must be in digital format of PDF or JPEG:

Accessing the I-20 request e-form

Please see the Requesting Your I-20 page of the OGS website.
You will be prompted to enter your myNortheastern username and password login. The myOGS I-20 request e-form will respond to your individual situation and guide you through the process. Please ensure that you check “Yes” when asked if you have been admitted to the N.U.in program for the Fall Semester. (Contact the Office of Global Services with any questions)

What Do I Need to Know About My I-20?

You will be issued a new form I-20 for Spring 2025 when you will be matriculated into your degree program.
International students participating in the N.U.in program outside of the U.S. are not eligible for SEVIS transfer from previous institutions because the difference between the end of their high school program and the beginning of their U.S. portion of the N.U.in Program is more than five months.
Please do not ask your high school to transfer your SEVIS record to Northeastern if you are participating in N.U.in outside of the U.S. Your I-20 from Northeastern will be a new “initial” I-20 with a new SEVIS number, which means that you will need to pay another SEVIS fee and apply for a new F-1 visa.

Applying for the I-20

You can submit an initial I-20 request only after you have been admitted to a program at Northeastern University. For many students, this means that you will be able to submit your request prior to your departure to your N.Uin program location in the Fall. You will also need to be sure to confirm other requirements needed by the admissions office before your I-20 request submission. At that time, you will then be able to submit an electronic I-20 request through myOGS. OGS encourages you to submit your initial I-20 request as soon as possible, ideally no later than November, to provide ample time for the issuance of the I-20 and your F-1 visa application process prior to your enrollment.

Applying for the F-1 Visa

We recommend that international students apply for an F-1 visa and attend a visa interview in their home country before beginning the N.U.in program. However, if you are not able to do so, and there is not time to return home prior to the spring semester in the U.S., contact the U.S. embassy in the country of the N.U. in program to check for the possibility of applying for an F-1 visa in the specific N.U.in location.

Step 1. Request Form I-20 from Northeastern
Step 2. Pay SEVIS I-901 fee online
Step 3. Fill out the visa application online (DS-160)
Step 4. Schedule a visa interview appointment online
Step 5. Go to the visa interview at the U.S. embassy
Step 6. Receive the visa stamp on their passport

Scheduling the F-1 visa appointment is a responsibility of the student. OGS can issue you an I-20 form, but you will need to reach out to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate and schedule your visa appointment. For any questions or concerns we suggest that you contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate directly. If an appointment in your N.U. in location is not possible, you need to look into the option of returning home and obtaining your F-1 visa prior to your departure to the U.S.
Note: For the “U.S. Point of Contact Information,” you can state the name of the Designated School Official (DSO) who signed your I-20 and if you don’t know your U.S. address, you can state the following address: (Northeastern University 360 Huntington Avenue Boston, MA 02115).
For “Present Employer or school name” please write the name of your current school.
If you have further questions for your F-1 visa application (DS-160) please reach out to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate.
You can also visit the OGS website for more information on the F-1 visa process.

Entering the U.S.

When preparing for your arrival to the U.S., you should plan your travel according to the information provided by your college. According to immigration regulations, F-1 student visa holders can enter the U.S. up to 30 days prior to the program report date on the I-20.
When you travel, please have the following documents in your carry-on bag:

Valid passport with an official F-1 visa stamp
Your original I-20 issued by Northeastern University
I-901 Student and Exchange Visitor Information System fee receipt
Financial documents
Admissions letter

At the U.S. port of entry, you will be required to present your passport and I-20 to the immigration officer who will stamp your passport. In most cases, the officer notes “D/S” (Duration of Status) on your passport pages. This means you are allowed to stay in the U.S. for the length of time indicated on your I-20, provided that you maintain full-time enrollment and a valid F-1 visa status. Ensure your passport is properly stamped before exiting the immigration inspection area. Do not enter the U.S.A in visitor status (B-1/B-2, WT, or WB). This status does not permit full-time study in the U.S. After your arrival, print your Admission (I-94) number at cbp.gov/I94 and keep a copy of all travel documents (I-94 information, F-1 visa, and I-20) for your personal records. Ensure your I-94 print out contains the correct information, including F-1 visa status and “Duration of Status.”
After arriving in the U.S., you will receive an email from OGS with instructions to complete your Immigration Clearance and Orientation. You should check your HuskyMail frequently and follow the directions by the deadlines provided. You can find more information about maintaining your F-1 status on the OGS website.

If your current valid visa status allows you to engage in study in the U.S., you can remain on that visa. However, if you want to find out more about the benefits of the F-1 immigration status, please feel free to contact OGS through the OGS Service Portal or by calling +1.617.373.2310.

Who do I need to notify if I do not need an I-20 because I have a valid visa that allows me to study in the U.S. and I am not interested in applying for F-1 visa, OR if I have a Green Card, and I don’t need an I-20 for my studies in the U.S.?

You should complete this Data Form for OGS.

I am from Canada and my friend is from Bermuda. Do we need an F-1 visa to enter the U.S. for our undergraduate program in the Spring?

Canadian and Bermudian citizens do not need visas to study in the U.S. However, you do need to request an I-20 and also pay the SEVIS fee.

What is the F-1 visa application process?

Step 1. Request Form I-20 from Northeastern
Step 2. Pay SEVIS I-901 fee online
Step 3. Fill out the visa application online (DS-160)
Step 4. Schedule a visa interview appointment online
Step 5. Go to the visa interview at the US embassy
Step 6. Receive the visa stamp on their passport

Please use your U.S. Embassy or Consulate website and the following OGS resource for more information on how to apply for an F-1 visa:
https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/f-1-visa-process/

If I am participating in N.U.in outside of the U.S., when can I apply for an F-1 visa for my undergraduate program in the Spring?

Wait times for interview appointments vary by location, season, and visa category, so you should apply for your visa early. An F-1 student visa for the U.S. can be issued up to 120 days in advance of your program start date in January. You can start the visa process as early as your I-20 is issued.

I am participating in N.U.in outside of the U.S. and I will not have time to go home after the end of my first semester abroad and apply for F-1 visa. Can I apply for the visa in the country abroad of my N.U. in Program?

We recommend that international students apply for an F-1 visa and attend an interview in their home country but if you will not have time to return home prior to your spring semester in the U.S., please contact the U.S. embassy in the country of your N.U.in program to check for the possibility of applying for an F-1 visa in your N.U.in location.  Please see the below list of embassies/consulates in N.U.in host countries for more information:

England
Germany
Greece
Ireland
Italy
Scotland
Spain – Bilbao
Spain – Madrid

I am having a hard time getting a U.S. visa appointment in my N.U.in location. Who should I contact?

Scheduling the F-1 visa appointment is a responsibility of the student. The OGS can issue you an I-20, but you will need to reach out to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate and schedule your visa appointment. For any questions and concerns we suggest that you contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate directly. If an appointment in you N.U. in location is not possible, you will need to look into the option of returning home and obtaining your F-1 visa prior to your departure for the U.S.

If I don’t have time to apply for an F-1 visa prior to coming to the U.S. for my Spring semester, can I enter the U.S. on my valid B-1/B-2/WB/WT visas and then apply for I-20 from here?

You will not be eligible to start your studies if you enter the U.S. on B-1/B-2/WB/WT visas. Your Form I-20 and F-1 visa stamp must be received prior to entering the U.S.

When do I need to request an I-20 for my program?

You will receive an e-mail from the Office of Undergraduate Admissions with information to start the online request for an I-20. If you are participating in N.U.in Bay Area, this I-20 will be for the fall term. If you are participating in N.U.in outside of the U.S., this I-20 request will be for your studies that will start in the spring term in Boston.

How will I receive my I-20?

Your I-20 will be emailed to your Northeastern email address as a password-protected pdf by the Office of Global Services.

What is the travel signature, and do I need a travel signature on my I-20 in order to travel to Northeastern University for my Spring semester?

A travel signature on an I-20 acknowledges that a student is full time and is maintaining his F-1 student status. You do not need to have a travel signature when you enter the U.S. for the first time on your “Initial” I-20.

What is SEVIS ID number and how can I find it on my I-20?

Each Form I-20 has a specific SEVIS ID number which is located on the top left-hand corner of your I-20 and starts with “N00.”

What is Program Code of Northeastern University and how can I find it on my I-20?

The program code is stated next to your major under the “program of study” section on your I- 20.

What should I write on the visa application (DS-160) for “U.S. Point of Contact Information” and “Present Employer or school name”?

For the “U.S. Point of Contact Information,” you can state the name of the Designated School Official who signed your I-20 and if you don’t know your U.S. address, you can state the following address: (Northeastern University 360 Huntington Avenue Boston, MA 02115).
For “Present Employer or school name” please write the name of your current school.
If you have further questions for your F-1 visa application please reach out to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate.

10 Points to remember When Applying for a Student Visa from NAFSA

I have received my I-20 form for the spring term. Can I travel for the N.U.in Pre-Departure Orientation that is organized in the U.S. during the summer on my F-1 visa and my Spring I-20 or I would need to apply for a tourist visa separately?

No, you will not be able to travel for the Orientation in the summer as your program start date on your Spring I-20 is in January. F-1 students are not allowed to enter the U.S. more than 30 days prior to the program start date of their initial Spring I-20. Please check about the possibilities of obtaining a Tourist visa if you wish to attend the Orientation.
*Important note: Due to U.S. visa regulations, international students are not required to attend this Orientation program and will receive information about a mandatory online orientation via email.

I need assistance with applying for a visa for my first semester abroad with the N.U.in Program. Whom do I need to contact?

The Office of Global Services does not assist with the visa process for your country abroad for the N.U.in Program fall semester. Visa information should be posted on the N.U.in website under Travel Information of your N.U.in Program destination. For more information please reach out to the N.U.in staff at [email protected].

When can I arrive in the U.S. for my program?

International students should not travel to the U.S. as F-1 students until they are ready to start their program in the U.S. This means that you can arrive as early as 30 days prior to the start date on your I-20.
About Deferrals

We at OGS understand that our international students have experienced many obstacles this year, as visa delays and travel restrictions have interfered with study plans. This is a stressful situation, and advisors and leadership at OGS prioritize our students’ need and want to ensure that all students have the information that needed in order to make the best decisions about your education.
If you have decided that deferring is the best decision, below you will find some information about how to navigate that process and prepare your record to join NU for the following term.

Deferral Process

1

The first step in the deferral process is to communicate with your college/ program through your admissions contact. They will need to update your admissions record to reflect your new start date. Please see the links below to discover the process for your program.

**If you are a continuing student, you do not need to contact admissions. Please be in touch directly with your department.

After your admissions contact in your college/ program has confirmed your deferral, you will need to request a new I-20 with a new program start date. This is important because it will 1) prevent your SEVIS record from being cancelled if you are not in the US this term and 2) will allow you to travel with current and accurate documents.

Request a new I-20
Requests for I-20s for programs starting in Spring/Winter 2025 terms will be available from OGS in Summer 2024.
If you had previously paid for the I-901 SEVIS fee, you will be able to request SEVP to transfer that payment to your new SEVIS record once it has been created.

Frequently Asked Questions

×

Will I need another DS-2019 if my spouse or child are accompanying me?

Yes, you will. In this case, you will need to apply for additional DS-2019s (one for each dependent). You will also be expected to provide additional documentation for each dependent with your request.

What is the school code on my DS-2019?

It is on your DS-2019 and it is P-1-03057.

Do I need to have a different DS-2019 if I am a non-degree exchange visitor?

The DS-2019 document is the same and it does not look different, except the section on major area of study.

How will I know if I am subject to a Two-Year Home Residence Requirement on my DS-2019?

You will see it marked on the bottom of the document if you are subjected to a Two-Year Home Residence Requirement.

Will my DS-2019 need to be signed before I travel to the U.S.?

Yes, you will have to sign your DS-2019 on the bottom of the document and include the name of the city where you will be studying, too.
Basics of F-1 Dependents

A dependent is a spouse or children (unmarried under the age of 21). If you would like to have dependents accompany you during your study in the U.S., you will need to indicate this when completing your I-20 request e-form as well as providing the following:

provide a copy of the identity page of the passport for your dependent(s).
show additional funding on your financial documents for your dependents:

For your spouse: add $10,000 to the estimated expenses for your program of study.
For your child/children: add $6,000 per person to the estimated expenses for your program of study.

Applying for F-2 Dependent Visa

New students may choose to apply for F-2 I-20’s for family members while they apply for their initial I-20.
Also, current continuing students and students on Optional Practical Training may request an I-20 for a dependent by using the Request for Student and Exchange Visitor Information System I-20/DS-2019.
Once your dependent receives their F-2 I-20, they will need to schedule their visa appointment at a U.S. Consulate abroad. It may be possible for them to apply for their F-2 visas at the same time that you have an appointment to obtain your F-1 visa. You should check with the consulate you plan to visit for details. It is also possible for your dependent(s) to join you in the U.S. at a later time. Pay close attention to the important information below:

Dependents do not need to pay a Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) fee
F-2 dependents may not work during their stay in the U.S.
Your F-2 spouse may study part-time, and F-2 children should attend school full time while you study in the U.S.

Basics of J-1 Dependents

A J-1 exchange visitor spouse, and unmarried children under the age of 21, are eligible for J-2 status. The day the child turns 21 he or she is no longer eligible for a dependent J-2 status. Each J-2 dependent must have his or her own Form DS-2019. J-2 visa holders do not have to pay the SEVIS fee.
Each J-2 dependent may accompany or follow to join the J-1 exchange visitor in the U.S. while the J-1 exchange visitor maintains status. All J-2 dependents are required to comply with applicable federal regulatory requirements. Please see Maintaining J-2 Status section below for more information.
After arriving in the U.S., to request DS-2019 for accompanying dependent(s), please submit Request for Student and Exchange Visitor Information System I-20/DS-2019. Please note, you may need to show additional funding for dependent expenses.

Obtaining a J-2 Visa

Spouse and/or children (under age 21) will receive his/her own SEVIS generated DS-2019, with his/her own SEVIS number.

The J-2 visa may be obtained by bringing the dependent’s DS-2019 form and proof of adequate funding to a U.S. Consulate.
Proof of marriage for spouse and a birth certificate for each child may be requested for J-2 visa applicants.
You are also required to complete a separate visa application form for each child, even if they are included on a parent’s passport.

It is preferred that families apply for J-1 and J-2 visas at the same time, but if the spouse and children must apply separately at a later time, they should bring copies of the student visa holder’s passport with the J-1 visa stamp and his/her DS-2019 along with all other required documents.

Maintaining J-2 status

J-2 dependents may study part-time or full-time in the U.S. while the J-1 exchange visitor is in valid status
J-2 dependents must also be covered by health insurance for the duration of the J-1 program
J-2 dependent children over the age of 21 are no longer eligible for J-2 status and will need to change to another status if they wish to remain in the U.S.

What is an F-1 Student Visa?

The F-1 visa is a non-immigrant, student visa that enables international students to enter the U.S. to study in full-time degree programs. Please carefully review the information below to better understand the F-1 visa application process and to prepare for your F-1 visa interview.

Applying for an F-1 Visa

For comprehensive information about the F-1 student visa application process, please visit the U.S. Department of State website.
Students are encouraged to apply for their F-1 visa as soon as they receive their Northeastern Form I-20. U.S. Embassies or U.S. Consulates are able to issue F-1 entry visas up to 365 days before the program start date listed on your I-20.
In most countries, student visa applicants must appear in person for the visa interview. However, each U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate sets its own interview policies and procedures. Students should consult the specific embassy website or call for application instructions.

Visit the Website of U.S. Embassies, Consulates, and Diplomatic Missions

For a contact person, you can put the name of the person who signed your I-20. You can find this information under “School Attestation” on your I-20.

Visa application fee payment receipt (visit the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate website for specific instructions)
Form I-20 issued by OGS at Northeastern University
Valid passport (the passport should be valid for at least six months after your date of entry into the U.S.)
Evidence of financial support (proof of sufficient funds for estimated cost of one academic year)
Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) I-901 fee payment receipt
A copy of your acceptance letter to Northeastern University
One photograph (see the U.S. Department of State website for photo requirements)

All applicants should be prepared to provide additional information, such as transcripts or diplomas from previously attended institutions, or documents which demonstrate that the applicant intends to return home after their studies. Dependents will receive their own I-20 with their own unique SEVIS ID to apply for the F-2 visa. Dependents are not required to pay the SEVIS fee.
No assurances regarding the issuance of visas can be given in advance. Therefore, final travel plans or the purchase of non-refundable tickets should not be made until a visa has been issued. After the visa has been issued, please be sure the F-1 visa stamp in your passport is accurate and that your original I-20 has been returned to you as you will need to have it in hand when entering the U.S.
Note: Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not need to apply for an F-1 visa but they are required to have the I-20 and pay the SEVIS I-901 fee before entering the U.S. to study.

10 Points to Remember When Applying for a Student Visa

Please use this guide from NAFSA for your reference: 10 Points to Remember When Applying for a Student Visa.

Visa Application Outcomes

Approval

Congratulations! The majority of F-1 visa applicants are approved. You may be informed in the interview of the approval or after. They may keep your passport for a period of time to add the visa stamp before returning it to you.

Denials

Although F-1 visa denials are rare, the most common visa denial is under 214(b), which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non-immigrant intent, and/or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country (family, job, education, property) that indicate they will not immigrate to the U.S. and instead will return home after their students and any qualifying periods of post-completion OPT or STEM OPT.
The F-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer’s questions and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when an F-1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial.
If your F-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. Most individuals are eligible to apply again for the F-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial.
You can also review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa denials.

Administrative Processing

The outcome of some F-1 visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as “Administrative Processing.” Administrative Processing can take anywhere from several days to several months. In these cases, the consular officer will let you know if they require additional documentation or information, or whether the case requires additional internal administrative processing. Please note that this is not a visa denial. You should follow the instructions listed on the 221(g) notice and provide any requested information or documentation to the embassy.
If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310. You will be instructed to share the 221(g) notice with an OGS advisor for further review.
Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing.

Expedited Visa Appointments

U.S. Embassies/Consulates overseas may be able to expedite your F-1 visa interview date if your I-20 program start date is within 60 days, and there are no available visa interview slots prior to your start date.
The process to request an expedited F-1 visa interview varies by location. You should refer to the instructions on the website of the Embassy or Consulate Visa Section where you will interview, or on their online appointment scheduling site. You will need to provide proof of the need for an earlier appointment (such as your I-20 showing a program start date within 60 days).
Please note: You must first submit the online visa application form (DS-160), pay the application fee, and schedule the first available interview appointment. Only at this point will a consular section consider your request for an expedited appointment.

Entering the U.S.

When preparing for your arrival to the U.S., you should plan your travel according to the information provided by your college. According to immigration regulations, F-1 student visa holders can enter the U.S. up to 30 days prior to the program report date on the I-20.
Students transferring to Northeastern University in F-1 status from another institution or changing their degree level at Northeastern may stay in the U.S. or travel between programs. And, they may enter the U.S. more than 30 days before the new program start date listed on your I-20.
Documents to Bring When Entering the U.S.

Valid passport with an official F-1 visa stamp
Your original I-20 issued by Northeastern University
I-901 SEVIS fee receipt
Financial documents
Admissions letter

At the U.S. port of entry, you will be required to present your passport and I-20 to the immigration officer who will stamp your passport. In most cases, the officer notes “D/S” (Duration of Status) on your passport pages. This means you are allowed to stay in the U.S. for the length of time indicated on your I-20, provided that you maintain full-time enrollment and a valid F-1 visa status.
Ensure your passport is properly stamped before exiting the immigration inspection area. Do not enter the U.S. in visitor status (B-1/B-2, WT, or WB). This status does not permit full-time study in the U.S.
After your arrival, print your Admission (I-94) number at cbp.gov/I94 and keep a copy of all travel documents (I-94 information, F-1 visa, and I-20) for your personal records. Ensure your I-94 print out contains the correct information, including F-1 visa status and “Duration of Status.”

If I already have a visa from another university or college in the U.S. - do I need to get a new one for Northeastern?

If you received a transfer pending I-20 from Northeastern with the same SEVIS identification as from your previous institution, as reflected on your F-1 visa page in passport, then you will not need to renew your F-1 visa for Northeastern. If your current visa from another institution already expired and/or you are planning to go abroad before starting at Northeastern or during your program, then you will need to renew your F-1 visa before reentering the U.S.

Do I need to go to the U.S. Consulate before re-entering the U.S.?

If your F-1 visa expired and you are not subject to automatic visa re-validation, then you will need to go to the U.S. Consulate in order to get your F-1 visa renewed.

Is it possible for me to apply for a visa in a country different from my home country?

Although, we recommend that you apply for an F-1 visa in your home country, you can apply for your visa in another foreign country. Please contact the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate where you intend to apply for more information on the process.

Is there a limit to the number of dependents that I can bring to the U.S.?

I-20 request e-form has a limit of up to four dependents. If you intend to bring more, please contact OGS.

Can I bring family members as dependents that are not spouses or children?

The only family members that can receive an F-2 visa are spouses and children under the age of 21.

What is the I-901 Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) fee and how do I pay it?

The I-901 SEVIS fee is one of the required fees that must be paid to allow students to be approved for an F-1 visa. Proof of payment will be asked at the visa interview. You can learn how to pay this fee and receive the I-901 confirmation receipt here.

Where do I find the school code which is needed for the online visa application?

The school code should be stated under “School Information” section on your I-20.

My DS-160 application requires for me to include the address where I will stay in the U.S. and a contact person. However, my address in the U.S. has not been finalized.

If your address in the U.S. is not available yet, you can use the Northeastern University address:
Office of Global Services
354 Richards Hall
360 Huntington Avenue
Boston, MA 02115
[email protected]
For a contact person, you can put the name of the person who signed your I-20. You can find this information under “School Attestation” on your I-20.

I am a new initial F-1 student who will enter the U.S. for the first time. Do I need a travel signature?

A travel signature is not needed when you enter the U.S. for your program of studies for the first time.
Applying for a J-1 visa

If Northeastern is sponsoring your J-1 visa, the Office of Global Services (OGS) will be in touch to process your DS-2019.
If Northeastern is not the organization sponsoring your visa (Fulbright or Science Without Borders, for example), then your exchange organization will prepare your DS-2019 and send it to you. With the DS-2019, you may start the visa application process:

Check your passport’s validity. It must be valid for at least six months from the date you return to the U.S.
Pay the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) fee
Gather supporting documents for the visa interview
Make an appointment at the nearest U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate for a visa interview

The U.S. Department of State has published estimated Global Visa Wait Times on their website.

Remember that the DS-2019 does not guarantee a U.S. exchange visa. At your interview, you will be asked about your study plans, ties to your home country, future career objectives, and how you will fund your education in the U.S.

Necessary documents

In general, international students may apply for a J-1 visa by presenting the following documents to the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate:

Certificate of Eligibility for nonimmigrant visa (DS-2019) issued by Northeastern University. Your assigned SEVIS identification number is in the upper right corner of the page. Check to see that all information is correct. NOTE: The spelling of your name and your date of birth must be exactly the same as what appears in your passport. Read the regulations governing J visa status on page 2 and sign and date the bottom of the page. Please read and sign the DS-2019 prior to presentation at the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate.
Valid passport. Passport must be valid for at least six months after your proposed date of entry into the U.S.
Financial evidence that shows you have sufficient funds to cover your tuition (if applicable) and living expenses during the period you intend to study. At a minimum, you must prove you have sufficient funds for the length of your intended period of study as reflected on your DS-2019. If you have more than one source of funding, please provide the required documentation corresponding to each source listed on the DS-2019 e.g.: personal or family funds, sponsorship letter, Northeastern award or scholarship letter, etc.
Proof of the SEVIS I-901 fee payment – see additional information below.
Admission letter from Northeastern University.
Complete the Nonimmigrant Visa Electronic Application Form (DS-160). Visit the U.S. Department of State site for Instructions and Frequently Asked Questions.
One photograph, please read detailed information on photo requirements.
Visa application fee: Check with the consulate for the fee amount and how it must be paid. This is separate from the SEVIS fee.

All applicants should be prepared to provide additional information, such as transcripts and diplomas from previously attended institutions, Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores, or documents which demonstrate the applicant intends to return home after his/her studies, etc.

Proof of assessment

A nonimmigrant visa is the proof of assessment conducted by the officials at the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate that certifies a person may seek admission to the U.S. for a specific purpose. Therefore, you will need to submit certain required documents at the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate to explain the purpose of your visit to the U.S. Your Certificate of Eligibility document (DS-2019) is necessary to obtain a nonimmigrant (J-1) student visa to attend Northeastern University. Do not enter the U.S. in visitor status (B-1, B-2, WT, or WB). If you enter the U.S. on a tourist visa or on a Visa Waiver Program, you will be required to leave the U.S. in order to re-enter on a proper student visa. For detailed information please refer to the website.

Obtaining a visa

If you are intending to attend Northeastern University, then you will need to use Northeastern’s DS-2019 to pay the SEVIS fee and apply for a student visa. To obtain a student visa, the applicant must submit a valid DS-2019 form issued by Northeastern to the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate in his/her country. Students are encouraged to apply for their visa as soon as they receive the DS-2019 to provide ample time for visa processing. Once students have received their J visa, they are permitted to enter the U.S. 30 days in advance of the report date if they wish. In most countries, student visa applicants must appear in person for an interview. However, each U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulate sets its own interview policies and procedures regarding student visas, thus students should consult the embassy websites or call for specific application instructions. For the current listings of U.S. Embassies and U.S. Consulates abroad, we recommend the following web link from the U.S. Department of State. Visit the U.S. Department of State website for the latest information on visa processing, required material, visa applications and processing times.
NOTE: No assurances regarding the issuance of visas can be given in advance. Therefore, it is recommended that final travel plans or the purchase of nonrefundable tickets should not be made until a visa has been issued. After the visa is granted and processed, check your passport to be sure you received a J-1 visa stamp and that any dependents received J-2 visa stamps. Also, be certain that the original DS-2019 was returned to you, as you must have the original with you when you arrive to the U.S. Sometimes, the document is returned to you in a sealed envelope (in this case, do not open the envelope), which must be presented to the immigration inspector when you arrive.

Canadian citizens

Canadian citizens do not need a J-1 student visa, but they must have a DS-2019 and pay the SEVIS fee before entering the U.S. Upon the receipt of the DS-2019 from Northeastern, Canadian students may enter the U.S. by presenting the DS-2019, valid passport, the admission letter from Northeastern, evidence of financial support, and proof of SEVIS I-901 fee payment. The SEVIS fee cannot be paid at the port of entry.

Admission to the U.S.

According to immigration regulations, J-1 student visa holders can seek admission to the U.S. up to 30 days prior to a program’s report date as shown on the DS-2019. At the U.S. port of entry, you will be required to present your valid passport and the DS-2019 form to a representative of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. After reviewing all of required documents, a Customs and Border Protection officer will stamp your passport if admission is granted. An admission stamp will show the date of admission and class (J-1) of admission, and the duration of your stay. In most cases, the officer notes “Duration of Status” on the stamp. This means you are allowed to stay in the U.S. for the length of time indicated on your DS-2019 form, so long as you are maintaining full-time enrollment at the school that issued your DS-2019 form. Be sure that your passport is properly stamped before exiting the inspection area at a U.S. port of entry. For detailed information, please visit U.S. Custom and Borders Protection.

Reporting to Northeastern

International students should arrive on campus no later than the program’s report date and report in person to the OGS during scheduled international immigration clearance. Completing international student check-in is essential for compliance with university policies and federal government requirements. Failure to register with OGS in a timely manner may result in the loss of your lawful J-1 status.

Health insurance requirement

J-1 exchange visitors are required to meet the health insurance requirements set forth in regulations issued by the Department of State:

Medical benefits of at least $100,000 per accident or illness
Repatriation of remains in case of death in the amount of $25,000
Expenses in the amount of $50,000 associated with the medical evacuation of the J-1 exchange visitor to his or her home country
A deductible amount not to exceed $500 per accident or illness

As a J-1 exchange visitor, health insurance that satisfies the above-mentioned requirements is mandatory and must be maintained throughout the duration of your program. The Northeastern Student Health Insurance Plan satisfies these requirements.

Residency requirement

A J-1 exchange visitor may be subject to the “Two-Year Home Country Physical Presence Requirement.” If the exchange visitor is subject to the two-year home-country physical presence (foreign residence) requirement, he or she cannot change his/her status to that of H, L, K, or immigrant lawful permanent resident until he or she has returned to his/her home country for at least two years or received a waiver of that requirement. To become subject to this requirement, one of the following criteria is met:

If you are financed in whole or in part by an agency of the U.S. governmnt or by your home country’s government
If your field of study is listed on a special “Skills List” designated by the Exchange Visitor Program

You will need to apply for the exchange visitor J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate in your country of residence. To search for an embassy or consulate near you, please check here.

Can I transfer to Northeastern as a J-1 student?

You may be eligible to obtain a Northeastern DS-2019 as a transfer student; however, the U.S. institution from where you are transferring out has to process your transfer request before the completion date of your current program at that institution. The area of study for your transfer program at Northeastern must be the same as your area of study at your current institution. You will need to work with your current institution’s international student office in order to follow the transfer out process and you will also need to work with OGS for the transfer in process.
F-1 visa applicants

A SEVIS I-901 fee payment is required for F-1 students and the receipt must be included with all F-1 visa applications. Those seeking an F-1 visa are subject to a SEVIS fee of $350. Students should be prepared to present the SEVIS I-901 fee payment receipt at the U.S. port of entry. Students with a country of citizenship or country of birth of Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, or Gambia must pay by money order, Western Union Quick Pay or certified check drawn from a U.S. bank. All other students also have the option to make a credit card payment. Click here to pay the SEVIS fee.

J-1 visa applicants

A SEVIS fee receipt must be included with most visa applications. Those seeking a J-1 visa are subject to a SEVIS fee of $220. Students should be prepared to present this payment receipt at the U.S. port of entry. Canadian citizens must also pay the SEVIS fee before entering the U.S. J-2 dependents are not required to pay the SEVIS fee. The SEVIS fee cannot be processed at a U.S. Consulate or U.S. ports of entry. However, the fee can be paid on the processing website for SEVP.

SEVIS Fees

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has increased federal fees charged by the SEVP to international students and exchange visitors.

The I-901 SEVIS Fee for F international students: $350
J Exchange Visitors fees: $220

Federal regulation requires all prospective international students and exchange visitors to pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee upon receipt of Form I-20 or DS 2019 and prior to scheduling the visa appointment with U.S. consulates abroad.
OGS encourages students and Exchange Visitors to pay the SEVIS fees themselves using their own funds, rather than using a third party to pay.
Additional information on visa applications and processes can be found on Study in the States website.

Travel Dates

(Updated 02/28/2024)

All F-1 and J-1 students are expected to arrive at Northeastern University by the program start date that is listed on their Form I-20/DS-2019 in order to appropriately abide by federal regulations. The program start dates on the Form I-20/DS-2019 are aligned with the Academic Calendar of the University. Plan on arriving by the first day of the program start date listed on your Form I-20/DS-2019.
Remember: Students can only enter the United States 30 days before the program start date listed on their Form I-20/DS-2019. Students who attempt to enter the U.S more than 30 days before their program start date may be found inadmissible by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Late Arrival
We recognize that some students may experience extenuating circumstances outside of their control, and that may delay their arrival by a few days. If you find out that you are unable to arrive for the first day of classes, you must notify your College contact. For your convenience, you may click here for a list of each College’s contacts.
*No late arrivals may be approved by your College beyond the University Add/Drop deadline.
Last Day of University Add/Drop – Spring 2024 (last day to add classes)

Graduate Spring Quarter 2024 Students
4/22/2024

*If your Form I-20/DS-2019 has not yet been issued by your program’s start date, you are not eligible for late arrival and you will be required to defer your program. Please find more information here.
If your College contact approves your late arrival request, you will receive a support letter in an email. A late arrival support letter does not guarantee entry to the U.S. as all students should be entering the U.S. by the program start date listed on their I-20/DS-2019.
Upon entry to the U.S., you must complete the Online Immigration Clearance check-in so OGS can activate your SEVIS record in a timely manner.
Students who may need to travel to the U.S. later than the Add/Drop deadline must work with their College to defer enrollment to the next academic term. Please find more information here.

Required Documents

Travel documents required for entry into the United States

Valid entry visa for study in the U.S. (in most cases an F-1 visa or J-1 visa)

Apply for an Expedited Visa Appointment within 60 days of program start date: This option is limited only to students and exchange students who are within 60 days of their start date, and who have not been previously refused a visa within the last six months.

OGS is not able to provide letters nor is a letter required to request an expedited appointment if you’re eligible.

Visa supporting documents such as:

Form I-20 (F-1 students) or Form DS-2019 (J-1 students/scholars). Ensure that you have a valid travel signature on your document. Travel signatures can be requested here.

If your document is an Initial I-20 or DS-2019, you do not require a travel signature

Passport that is valid for at least six months after the intended entry into the US.

If you need assistance with your travel documents, please contact OGS.

Travel Steps

Apply for a visa

If you have recently applied for a F-1 or J-1 visa, submit the Visa Application Status form via myOGS. We do not recommend making travel plans until you have valid documents for travel.

Arrange your travel
Register your travel

Register your travel with the University’s Travel Registry
This is available via “MyTravelPlans” in the Student Hub or directly through the GardaWorld Travel Security Portal (sign in with your Northeastern email address).
More information on the Travel Registry can be found here and here.
Contact [email protected] for travel registry assistance.

Ensure that you have gathered and printed the following important paperwork and pack it in your carry-on luggage for easy access:

Original Form I-20 or DS-2019 (make sure you have signed it in the appropriate spot)
Acceptance Letter from Northeastern University
Proof of Funding (generally the financial documents you provided in your I-20/DS-2019 application) and/or a receipt of tuition payment (if available)
Proof of SEVIS Fee Payment (I-901 Fee Receipt)
Passport, valid for at least six months into the future from the date of your arrival
F-1/J-1 Visa Stamp (in your passport)

Research possible restrictions for the duration of your travel

Determine what is needed for you to comply with the relevant regulations for your travel (e.g. departure, connections, customs) according to your citizenship(s) and immigration documentation at each checkpoint.
Be aware of the specific exit requirements from your point of origin and the entry requirements at any transit points, as well as the point of entry in the United States.
Adhere to airlines’ COVID-19 safety requirements (if there are any).

If in doubt about any information, contact the relevant immigration or government authority of the countries of the travel.

After Landing in the U.S.

Primary Inspection
When you arrive at the U.S. Port of Entry, you will first go through Primary Inspection. This is where a Customs & Border Protection (CBP) officer will review your documents to determine if you may enter the U.S. They may also ask you some basic questions. Provide truthful answers and ask for clarification if needed. Here are some tips:

Be sure to tell the CBP officer that you will be studying at Northeastern University as an F-1 student, or a J-1 exchange visitor when you present your I-20 and F-1 visa or DS-2019 and J-1 visa.
You will be issued an electronic I-94, which indicates your nonimmigrant status in the U.S, which should be F-1 student status or J-1 exchange visitor status.
Currency: if you or the family members you are travelling carry currency amounting to more than $10,000, you must fill out an additional form to declare this. More information can be found here.
Food items: there are restrictions on certain food and agricultural items that are allowed into the US. Please reference the CBP website for more details

Generally, this step should not last more than a few minutes. Until recently, visa holders received an entry stamp in their passports, and the CBP officers noted D/S (Duration of Status) on F-1 and J-1 visa passport pages; this meant you are allowed to stay in the U.S. for the length of time indicated on your I-20 or DS-2019, provided that you maintain full-time enrollment and a valid F-1/J-1 visa status.
Many U.S. airports have discontinued stamping passports with an entry stamp when entering the U.S. Instead, each time you enter the U.S., the CBP creates an online, electronic entry record to record your entry into the U.S. This is called your I-94 record (Scroll down to read Check Your I-94 Record for more information).
If everything is in order, the CBP officer will return all of your documentation they inspected, and you can proceed to collect any checked luggage and/or transfer. Ensure that you have collected all of your belongings before exiting the immigration inspection area.
If the officer has additional questions, you may be directed to Secondary Inspection.
Secondary Inspection
Secondary Inspection (also called Deferred Inspection) allows a CBP officer more time to ask you additional questions and gather information to determine if you may be allowed entry. It is not a punishment and does not mean that you will be denied entry.
The officer may ask you additional questions or try to reach out to Northeastern to confirm your status. If additional information regarding your F-1 or J-1 status is needed, please request that the CBP officer calls the university to speak to a Designated School Official (DSO) for F-1 visa holders or Alternate Responsible Officer (ARO) for J-1 visa holders, using the following contact information (The operations center is staffed 24/7 for this purpose):

International Safety Office:

+1.617.373.2121 (NUPD)
[email protected]
This office is open even outside of normal business hours.
This office can best support you when you have registered your travel in advance so that they can easily access your travel details.

Office of Global Services:

+1.617.373.2310
Please see our Contact page for operations hours.

Most importantly, ensure that you cooperate with the officer as much as possible so as not to create further difficulties. More information on Secondary Inspection can be found here.

Check Your I-94 Record

The I-94 is an admission record that contains information about your most recent entry to the U.S. It is issued to all international travelers who enters the U.S. (with the exceptions of those who are part of a visa waiver program), and is updated with each entry you make. It contains your basic biographical information, as well as information about your visa status and how long you are allowed to remain in the U.S.
Once you have successfully cleared inspection and entered the US, you should retrieve your electronic I-94 record here. Note that it may take a few days after your entry for the record to populate. You should check and save a screenshot of your I-94 record each time you enter the U.S. as the I-94 is the only official evidence of your entry into the U.S.
Please review your I-94 record for accuracy. Two fields you may be unfamiliar with are “Class of Admission” and “Admit Until Date.” These fields should be filled out as follows:

Class of Admission: matches what is listed on your visa stamp
Admit Until Date: D/S (This stands for “Duration of Status”)

Visa status other than F-1/J-1 must be corrected immediately (B-1/B-2, WT, or WB status does not permit full-time study in the U.S.)
If anything looks incorrect on your I-94 record, please visit this page for more information on how to request a correction.

Form I-515 or I-515A

The CBP officer may issue you a Form I-515A if you are missing paperwork, or if they are not able to verify your status. This form allows you temporary entrance into the US for up to 30 days, during which time you must collect and submit the necessary evidence to the government to be able to remain in the US for the duration of your F-1 or J-1 status.
If you receive a Form I-515A, the Office of Global Services (OGS) is happy to provide guidance with your response to the government. Please complete the Request to Comply with I-515A e-form to notify us so that we may best assist.
Note that an I-515A should not have any negative impact on your status as long as you respond in a timely manner. More information on the form I-515A can be found here.

Departing the Airport

Car Service
A car service is great way to pre-arrange a convenient and safe ride from the airport to your final destination. OGS recommends Boston Carriage. Click here to visit their website and enter your reservation details. Use promo code HUSKY2020 for a 5% discount!
Tips for using Boston Carriage:

Book your ride in advance as soon as possible to guarantee that there is availability on your date of travel. You will receive detailed instructions about where to meet your driver upon your arrival.
Make sure to build in a 60-minute delay for clearing Customs & Border Protection and baggage claim after your flight arrival time.
Traveling with friends or family? Consider booking a van instead of a car so there is enough room for your luggage.
Expect “no-contact service” to decrease risk of COVID-19 transmission; this means all cars are outfitted with a partition between the driver and passenger area, the driver will be wearing a face mask, and vehicles will be sanitized before/after pick-up.

Ride-Share Apps (such as Uber or Lyft)

Download the app before you travel. You can log onto wifi at the airport to use the app and communicate with your driver.
Some airports, such as Boston-Logan, have a designated Ride App pick-up area. After collecting your luggage from baggage claim, follow signs and head to the appropriate spot before ordered the ride.
Always check that the license plate of the car matches the information in the app to make sure you are getting into the correct car.
Ask your driver to wear a mask and put down the windows for airflow to decrease risk of transmission of COVID-19.

Public Transportation
Depending on your final destination, public transportation can be a great way to get around your new city! Make sure to look up in advance directions to get from the airport to your destination. Many areas have a transportation app you can download before you arrive.

Traveling to Northeastern for Commencement

International students, who graduated in a previous academic term, but who want to participate in graduate ceremonies at a later date (for example, a student who graduates at the end of the fall academic term wants to participate in graduation ceremonies at the end of the spring academic term), will have a Completed SEVIS record if they did not apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT) or continue in a new academic program. This means that your F-1/J-1 visa and I-20/DS-2019 are no longer valid for entry to the U.S. (even if they have a future end date) as you are no longer enrolled in a program of study.

Do not request a travel signature since you are no longer eligible for this benefit.
Utilize alternate visas for travel to the U.S. such as a Visitor Visa or the Visa Waiver Program if you are a citizen of a participating country.

We send regular emails to students if an error occurs and we cannot process your Online immigration Clearance. As always, please pay attention to your husky email accounts for any updates.
Electronic arrival record/I-94

U.S. Customs and Border Protection inspects all foreign national students, scholars, dependents, and visitors to the U.S. arriving at an air, land, or sea border and grants admission to the U.S. in an appropriate immigration classification status (including F-1, J-1, etc). Admission to the U.S. in a specific immigration status is documented via an entry stamp in the passport as well as an electronic or paper I-94 arrival record. Electronic I-94 records can be downloaded and printed here.
Occasionally when entering the U.S., errors may occur on the passport stamp notation, electronic I-94 record, or paper I-94 card. These errors must be corrected to ensure that the status of the student, scholar, dependent, or visitor is documented properly and that immigration benefits (such as permission to study or work) are correctly applied.

What should the I-94 say?

How can I correct my I-94 record?

There are two ways to correct an I-94 card/record or a passport stamp notation. If you need immediate assistance or if the error was made on your paper I-94 card or passport stamp, then you must go in person to the Deferred Inspection Office. However, if your passport notation is correct and the error was made to your electronic I-94 record, then you may be able to resolve this matter by e-mail.

Customs and Border Protection

“Deferred Inspection” is part of Customs and Border Protection. “Deferred Inspection sites provide assistance to individuals at the time of entry or after their entry if an immediate decision was not determined. Typically, this is where F-1 or J-1 students and scholars go when they need to get an I-94 correction or a passport entry stamp.

Deferred Inspection Office

To correct an I-94 card/record or passport stamp in person, go to Logan International Airport – Terminal E and look for the Customs and Border Protection Office.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection hours:
Monday – Thursday
Terminal E, Room 500 (Lower level) 8:00 am to 4:00 pm*
Logan International Airport 617-568-1810
Boston, MA 02128
*Make sure to check the Customs and Border Protection website for any changes in business hours.
Take all of your original immigration documentation with you to this office and explain why you believe there is an error on your I-94 card, I-94 electronic record, or passport admission stamp, and ask for their assistance in having the error corrected.
If you are seeking correction to the I-94 card/record, or passport stamp of your dependent spouse or child, then your dependent must accompany you to the Deferred Inspection Office. Your dependent must take all of their original immigration documents with them.

Requesting an I-94 correction by e-mail

NOTE: Corrections to a paper I-94 card or passport stamp can only be done in person. Going to the Customs and Border Protection Deferred Inspection Office is also advisable for time-sensitive situations, as e-mail requests are handled only after all in-person cases are resolved.
However, if your passport admission stamp is correct, and there is an error on your I-94 electronic record, you may be eligible to request a correction of your electronic I-94. Email: [email protected]
To request a correction to your I-94 electronic record, send a clear e-mail request to Boston Customs and Border Protection explaining the situation and the correction that is being requested. You will receive a notification telling you that your correction has been made.
See sample letter below.

Guidelines on Maintaining Status
U.S. federal government regulations require all F-1 and J-1 international students to maintain valid immigration status. While it is your responsibility to maintain your status, the Office of Global Services is here to help guide you through the complexities of the U.S. government regulations and procedures.
Correcting Status
We understand that mistakes happen! Learn about what options may be available to correct your F-1 status and continue your studies on-campus.
J-1 Student Intern Requirements
The Office of Global Services (OGS) works with J-1 student interns to provide the guidance and support they need in maintaining their status, such as attending orientation, checking in on campus, health insurance, and social security numbers.
Reduced Course Load
F-1 and J-1 students must enroll in and maintain a full-time course load; however, federal regulations allow international students to reduce their course load in certain limited academic circumstances.
Summer Term
At Northeastern, classes run year-round. However, not all students are required or choose to study during the summer term. Whether you plan to study or travel, it is important to maintain your status in the summer.
Final Term
Some students do not have enough course requirements left in their final term to count as a full course load. Students in this situation may be allowed to enroll in less than a full course-load if certain criteria are met.
Program Extension
If you are unable to complete your program of study before the program end date on your I-20 or DS-2019, you must apply to OGS for a program extension at least 30 days before the program end date on your current I-20 or DS-2019.
Withdrawal from the University
Learn what options are available to F-1 students that need to withdraw from Northeastern University and what steps the Office of Global Services (OGS) will need to take.
Transferring Out
Occasionally, F-1 students will decide to transfer out of Northeastern University. When this occurs, the Office of Global Services (OGS) staff will support your decision and help you experience a seamless transition.
Dismissals
Learn what options regarding visa status are available to F-1 students who have been academically dismissed from Northeastern University.
Unlawful Presence
Learn more about the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) policy for F, J, or M visa holders regarding situations where immigration status has been violated.
The goal of the Office of Global Services (OGS) is to support you in achieving your personal, academic, and professional goals during your time in the U.S. As an international student with F-1 or J-1 nonimmigrant student status, in addition to the challenges of attending a degree program in a foreign country and navigating intercultural differences, you have the added responsibility of maintaining your F-1 or J-1 student status to remain in the U.S. and successfully complete your degree.

Maintaining Lawful F-1/J-1 Status

As an F-1 or J-1 student, you must meet certain obligations in order to maintain lawful immigration status. Maintaining status is necessary in order to receive the benefits of F-1 or J-1 status, such as employment authorization and program extension, and can be crucial to a successful application for a change or adjustment of non-immigrant status in the future. Failure to maintain your non-immigrant status can result in serious problems with immigration and could lead to deportation from the U.S.
F-1 Students: Please also review the information provided by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the Study in the States website regarding maintaining F-1 status.
Please be sure to click each section and item below and carefully read the information. Contact OGS if you have questions about these requirements.

Consequences of Not Maintaining Your Status
If you fail to maintain your F-1/J-1 status, your legal permission to remain in the U.S., utilize the F-1 or J-1 status benefits, such as practical training and employment, as well as your ability to return to the U.S. in the future, may be impacted. This also applies to your accompanying F-2/J-2 dependents' status.

If you think you may have violated your visa status, please immediately contact OGS, who will schedule an appointment with you to discuss your situation and your options. The options for regaining F-1 status after a status violation are outlined on the OGS website.

General Requirements

(Click each topic below for more information)

Immediately open and carefully read any emails you receive from [email protected] (the Office of Global Services email).

Our office will send any important information related to your F-1/J-1 status to your Northeastern email address.
Please add the OGS email address to your approved senders list in your Northeastern email account and frequently check your junk/spam folders for any missed emails from OGS.
Failure to read an important email from OGS will not be an acceptable excuse to the Department of Homeland Security for failing to maintain your F-1/J-1 status.

Report Any U.S. Address or Phone Number Changes

F-1 and J-1 regulations require that you report any change to your U.S. phone number or U.S. local address within 10 days of the change.
OGS is then required to report this change on your behalf in your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record. These changes are not reflected on your I-20/DS-2019 and do not require issuance of a new document.
Currently enrolled students should update this information in their Student Hub account.
Graduated students on post-completion OPT, STEM OPT, or AT should report their address update either in the SEVP portal or in myOGS.

Keep Copies of all Immigration-Related Documents (I-20s, DS-2019s, etc.)

OGS does not retain signed copies of your immigration documents, as it is your responsibility to maintain a record of these documents.
Save each immigration document you are issued during your F-1/J-1 status. You may need them in the future:

to document your employment history and your compliance with U.S. immigration regulations
for applications for immigration benefits to U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) or future visa applications to Department of State

For electronically issued I-20s, you must print and sign at the bottom of Page 1. We recommend you take a photo or scan a PDF of the signed document.
Students on the STEM OPT Extension: please keep copies of all fully executed Forms I-983 that you complete with your STEM employers (including all 12-month and final evaluations on Page 5).
J-1 students: please print and sign each digitally-signed DS-2019 that is issued to you. We recommend you keep copies of all DS-2019s issued to you either as paper documents or digitally-signed documents.

Report Changes to Your Immigration Status

Report any changes in your non-immigrant status from F-1/J-1 to any other status to OGS.

You can report a change to becoming a permanent resident (green card holder) using this e-form.
If your non-immigrant status changes to H-1B, you can submit the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form.

Attend the School Listed on Page 1 of your Form I-20 (F-1 Students) or DS-2019 (J-1 Students)

Submit the Mandatory Immigration Clearance Immediately Upon Arrival in the U.S. at the Start of your Program

All international students with F-1 or J-1 status must complete the mandatory Immigration Clearance at the start of each new program of study. This is a U.S. government regulation for students to maintain their non-immigrant status. OGS facilitates this process, which is called “online immigration clearance.” Students who do not complete the mandatory immigration clearance within the deadline are not maintaining status and are at risk of SEVIS record termination.
Students will receive emails regarding Immigration Clearance before the start of their academic program and can find more information regarding this process on the OGS website.

Keep Your Immigration Documents Accurate and Up to Date

Keep your passport valid at all times. The passport must be valid for at least 6 months into the future on the day you return to the U.S. from a trip abroad.
Your F-1/J-1 visa may expire while you are inside the U.S. You only need to renew your F-1/J-1 visa if you are going to travel outside of the U.S. and need to return.
Keep your I-20 or DS-2019 valid and accurate at all times and understand your end date. Remember that your I-20/DS-2019 is essentially a printout of your SEVIS record, and if things change, you must notify OGS so that the document can be updated.

Extend your I-20 prior to its expiration date if you are unable to complete your academic program by the original end date.
In the event of change of academic program or level, update your I-20 in a timely fashion in accordance with immigration regulations (see the “Change of Degree Level” section below)
Notify OGS if you decide to finish your degree online from overseas, stop your program earlier than anticipated, or end an authorized period of CPT/OPT/STEM OPT earlier than anticipated and depart the U.S.

Understand Your “Grace Period” After Program Completion

F-1 students who successfully complete their program are granted a 60-day grace period starting the day after their I-20 program end date.
J-1 students who successfully complete their program are granted a 30-day grace period starting the day after their DS-2019 program end date.
During the grace period, students can remain in the U.S. to travel or prepare to depart the U.S. Any on-campus employment must stop as of the I-20/DS-2019 program end date.
F-1 students are eligible to transfer out during the grace period if accepted to another U.S. SEVP-certified institution. J-1 students are not eligible to transfer out during the grace period.
F-1 and J-1 students are no longer eligible for program extension, change of degree level, or to apply for post-completion OPT or post-completion AT during the grace period.
If you have not requested OPT/AT or received approval to transfer out, and you depart the U.S. during the grace period, your SEVIS record will be completed and you are no longer eligible to re-enter on your current I-20 or DS-2019.

Study Requirements

(Click each topic below for more information)

Make Normal Academic Progress and Stay in Good Academic Standing

Review the academic requirements, academic policies, and minimum GPA requirements of your academic program and adhere to all requirements.
Failure to maintain normal academic progress and academic standing may result in academic probation, dismissal, suspension or other negative consequences which may impact your ability to maintain full-time enrollment and your F-1/J-1 status.
If you are academically dismissed, please review the OGS website and contact OGS as soon as possible to discuss your options.
Please be sure to reach out for academic support early and often if you are experiencing challenges with coursework.

Maintain Full-Time Enrollment

You must maintain full-time enrollment each academic term (except during designated vacation periods) and make continuous academic progress towards the completion of your program of study.
Full-time enrollment is as follows:

Undergraduate: minimum of 12 credit hours per term
Graduate: minimum of 8 credit hours per term (9 credit hours per term in a 3-credit enrollment system)
Graduate students who hold an assistantship: minimum of 6 credit hours per term
International students enrolled in NU Immerse/Global Pathways must follow the requirements of their programs

Information for Students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS)

The same rules regarding maintaining full-time enrollment, as explained above, apply to F-1 students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS), but there are important differences in program delivery. Courses in CPS span the entire academic term or may be offered in two sessions (A and B) but still count as one full academic term. CPS students must ensure that they are enrolled in on-ground courses throughout the entire term. For instance, F-1 students cannot enroll in courses that only occur in session A of the term and have no course enrollment in session B of the term.
F-1 students in CPS also cannot enroll in an online course without first speaking to an academic advisor to confirm their eligibility!

Please note, if F-1 students need to withdraw/drop from a course, they must withdraw/drop from the additional online course and not any of the on-ground core courses in order to maintain full-time enrollment.

Maintain On-Ground Presence in Classes

Students must maintain on-ground presence throughout the academic term. At Northeastern, there are four different defined instructional methods: Traditional, Hybrid, Live Cast, and Online. Traditional, Hybrid, and Live Cast courses meet the F-1 on-ground presence requirements.  Online courses do not meet the F-1 on-ground presence requirements.
You can learn more about the Defined Instructional Methods at Northeastern on the Registrar’s website.

Information for Students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS)

Courses in CPS span the entire academic term or may be offered in one of two sessions (A and B) throughout the academic term. CPS students must ensure that they are enrolled in on-ground courses throughout the entire term.

For instance, F-1 students cannot enroll in courses that only occur in session A of the term and have no course enrollment in session B of the term.

F-1 students in CPS also cannot enroll in an online course without first speaking to an academic advisor to confirm their eligibility!

Understand Limitations to Enrolling in Online Courses

F-1 students have strict limitations to online course enrollment imposed by the U.S. federal government.
In general, within minimum full-time credit requirements, F-1 students may be eligible to take a maximum of:

one 3-credit online course, or
one 4-credit online course in a 4-credit enrollment system or
up to three credits total for 1-credit courses, i.e., three 1-credit courses, or one 2-credit course and one 1-credit course

Enrolling in two 2-credit online courses is not acceptable and considered a violation of F-1 status

Students in NU Immerse/Global Pathways are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements

Once F-1 students have met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements, they may enroll in additional online or hybrid courses if needed/desired.

J-1 students are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements.
It is important that all F-1 and J-1 students contact their academic advisor before enrolling in online courses or withdrawing from any courses, so that they can make an informed decision about their enrollment.

Understand Limitations on Reduced Course Loads

With minor exceptions for non-required summer terms and your final term, you must maintain full-time enrollment and should not drop below a full-time courseload unless you have received authorization from OGS in advance.
Students should not take a reduced course load or a non-medical leave of absence without discussing these options and obtaining authorization from OGS before the start of the term or before dropping any course(s) that would drop below full-time enrollment.
Please see sections on reduced course load and leaves of absence for more information on these topics.

Request a Leave of Absence in Advance

If you need to take a Medical Leave of Absence or a Personal Leave of Absence, you must submit requests to both the University and OGS in advance.
Do not drop or withdraw from your classes without final approval from OGS. There is no retroactive leave of absence authorization for students who drop classes without being approved for a leave.

Follow Requirements for Study or Research Abroad

Study Abroad: If you are approved for a university-approved study abroad experience through the Global Experience Office, you must submit a Study Abroad I-20 request to OGS.

You are required to maintain full-time enrollment in order to maintain your F-1 immigration status while studying abroad. Any changes in enrollment during your study abroad program could affect your ability to return to the U.S. Please refer to the OGS website for more information.

Research Abroad: To be approved by OGS for research abroad, you must maintain your full-time registration status at Northeastern University. Additionally, your overseas research project must be required to complete your degree. Please refer to the OGS website for more information.

Notify OGS of Any Change in Program or Degree Level in Advance

If you are a current, continuing student at Northeastern and you will be starting a new program at Northeastern, you must submit a Change of Degree Level (CDL) eForm request to myOGS prior to starting the new program.

This does not apply to undergraduate students who are changing majors.

Please review OGS’ CDL webpage for more information and instructions: Change of Degree Level – officeofglobalservices (northeastern.edu)

Notify OGS of Any Change of Major in Advance

If you are a current, continuing undergraduate student at Northeastern and you will be 1) changing your major or 2) declaring your major, you must submit a I-20 of DS-2019 Request for Continuing Students e-form request to myOGS prior to starting the new program. This applies to students in the Explore Program and the General Studies Program.
Once your request is reviewed and processed by OGS, you will receive a new I-20 with the same SEVIS ID number reflecting the new program information. You will not be required to submit an Immigration Clearance again for this new degree.
If you are currently in a Master’s program and you are changing from one Master’s degree program to another Master’s degree program (either after completing the first, or without completing), please see Change of Degree Level information above.

Transferring to Another U.S. School

If you are an F-1 student who would like to transfer your SEVIS record from Northeastern University to another SEVP-certified institution, you should review the Transferring Out page of the OGS website and must submit a transfer out request to OGS so that we can release your SEVIS record.
To have your SEVIS record transferred to your new institution, you must continue to maintain your F-1 student status per federal regulations. You may request that our office transfer your SEVIS record prior to the end of your program at Northeastern, but the date that your new university receives your record should occur after you have completed your program or after your last date of attendance.

Please Note: If you have already completed your program, you must be sure to request your transfer out within your 60-day grace period.

Notify OGS if you will Finish or End Your Degree/Program Early

F-1 students in their final term (even if it is earlier than their current I-20 end date) should review the Final Term page of the OGS website and submit the Intent to Complete eForm linked on that page.

PLEASE NOTE: Even if your current I-20 has remaining time, if you will be finishing your degree/program early, you must notify OGS in advance so this can be updated to reflect the term in which you completed all requirements for graduation. Remaining in the U.S. without full-time enrollment or taking other action to maintain/extend status even if your I-20 is still valid is not considered maintaining status.

If you are in your final term and are planning on applying for post-completion OPT or AT, your program end date will be adjusted accordingly if needed when OGS processes your request.

Notify OGS if you will Finish or End Your Degree/Program Later Than Expected

If you need additional time to complete your degree requirements, beyond your current I-20 or DS-2019 end date, you must apply for a Program Extension.
To maintain your status, you must apply for this extension before your current I-20 or DS-2019 program end date.
You can find more information about the Program Extension process on the OGS website.
Please note: Intentionally failing classes to extend your I-20/DS-2019 is not a legitimate reason for a program extension and may be a violation of academic integrity policies which may impact your F-1/J-1 status.

J-1 Student Requirements

Please note that the requirements below are specific to students with J-1 status, who were issued a Form DS-2019. (Click each topic below for more information)

Understand J-1 Student Status

The J-1 Exchange Visitor Program is administered by the U.S. Department of State and was created in 1961 to “…promote mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries by means of educational and cultural exchange […]”. Cultural and educational exchange are the primary purpose of this visa program.
To learn more about the J Exchange Visitor Program, please read the U.S. Department of State’s Welcome Brochure or Bridge USA J-1 Student Page which summarizes many of your rights. You can find contact information for the U.S. Department of State below.
Telephone: (866) 283-9090
Email: [email protected]

Maintain Full-Time Enrollment & On-Ground Presence

If you are in the J-1 student degree category (bachelor’s, master’s, doctorate) and enrolled in a full-time degree program, the same requirements above in the “Study Requirements” section regarding full-time enrollment and maintaining on-ground presence apply to you.
You may only count one online class towards your full-time enrollment requirement. Once you have met the full-time, on-ground enrollment requirement, you are eligible to take additional online classes that exceed your minimum credit requirements.

Maintain Health Insurance Coverage

All J-1 exchange visitors, and their J-2 dependents, are required to have health insurance coverage that meets the specific Department of State requirements below for the duration of their DS-2019 program length:

Medical benefits of at least $100,000 per accident or illness
In case of death, repatriation of remains in the amount of $25,000
Expenses in the amount of $50,000 associated with the medical evacuation of the J Exchange Visitor to his or her home country
A deductible amount not to exceed $500 per accident or illness
Continuous coverage for the duration of the program

If you purchased health insurance in your home country, please ensure that it covers all of the requirements listed above. OGS is not able to review individual plans to ensure they comply with these requirements. Please contact your health insurance provider to confirm your plan meets all requirements.
The Northeastern Student Health Insurance Plan (NUSHP) meets the Department of State requirements.
If your health insurance plan does not cover repatriation & medical evacuation, there are supplemental plans you can purchase to meet this requirement, including this plan offered by Gallagher Student Health & Special Risk.
Willful non-compliance with this requirement would be a violation of your J-1 status and may result in termination of your SEVIS record.

Matriculation & Changing Degree Level

J-1 degree-seeking students may be eligible to continue their program at a higher degree level through a process called “Matriculation.” This is only permissible to move to ah higher degree level, for example – Bachelor‘s to Master’s or Master’s to Doctorate/PhD. If you are in the J-1 non-degree student category, you are not eligible for Matriculation as that would require a change of your J-1 category.

Two-Year Home Residence Requirement (212e)

Some J-1 are subject to the two-year home country physical presence requirement. It requires you to return home for at least two years after your exchange visitor program ends. You can check your visa stamp and consular-processed DS-2019 to see whether you are subject.
Please read the OGS website for more information to understand this requirement and contact OGS if you have questions.

12- and 24-Month Bars

The 12- and 24-month bars are different from the two-year home country residence requirement. The 12- and 24-month rule affects J-1 exchange visitors who have been in the U.S. inJ-1 status previously, and wish to return, using the J-1 Research Scholar.
If you are in the J-1 degree student category and have a program length longer than 6 months, please note that you will automatically become subject to the 12-month bar. This will only impact your ability to return to the U.S. in the J-1 Research Scholar/Professor categories for 12 months (commonly used for Visiting Scholars/Researchers/Professors and Postdoctoral Fellows).
Please review the OGS website for more information about the bars.

Employment Requirements

Employment is a benefit of F-1/J-1 status that has specific requirements and restrictions. You should be aware of these requirements and work only with permission and within the limits of your authorization. Working in the U.S. without appropriate authorization is a serious violation of your status. (Click each topic below for more information)

Limit on-campus employment to 20 hours per week during the academic year.

Although F-1 student on-campus employment does not require a specific authorization from OGS unless you need a social security number letter, you must be aware of the restrictions on number of hours you can work during academic and vacation terms.
J-1 student employment does require authorization in advance from OGS.
Please read the on-campus employment pages for more information.

Obtain proper work authorization in advance before engaging in ANY off-campus employment (including AT/CPT/OPT/STEM OPT).

Do not engage in any off-campus work without appropriate authorization from OGS or USCIS (depending on the authorization type).
Please review the off-campus employment and working after graduation sections of the OGS website for eligibility and requirements for these types of off-campus work authorizations.

Ensure that any work authorization documents (a CPT I-20, OPT EAD, STEM OPT EAD, etc.) are active and have valid dates any time you are working off-campus.

Submitting a request to OGS without receiving an approval does NOT grant you work authorization.

Contact OGS before engaging in “volunteer opportunities” or unpaid internships

The regulations surrounding what is considered a true “volunteering” opportunity are complex. Before accepting such opportunities, review the OGS website to determine if the opportunity meets the criteria established by the Department of Labor for true “volunteering,” and contact OGS with questions.

I want to take only online classes in this term. Am I eligible for a reduced course load?

No. International students are not allowed to only take classes online for an academic term.

I received a reduced course load in my first term. Can I still be less than full-time in my final term?

Yes, if you don’t need full-time course load to complete your program, you can still be less than full-time in your final term even if you received a reduced course load prior to your final term.
Summer Enrollment at Northeastern

During required academic terms, F-1 and J-1 students must maintain full-time enrollment and appropriate on-ground presence. While the summer term is considered a vacation term for most continuing students, some students are required to maintain full-time enrollment in the summer. Please read the following information carefully to make sure you understand your summer enrollment requirements.
What summer terms are available at Northeastern?

Northeastern offers four distinct terms of enrollment in the summer:

Full Summer (semester-based programs)
Summer 1*(semester-based programs)
Summer 2*(semester-based programs)
Summer Quarter (CPS graduate students in quarter-based programs)

*Degree-seeking students that are eligible to enroll in summer 1 only or summer 2 only may enroll in half of their typical full-time enrollment requirement (6 credits for undergraduate students and 4 credits for graduate students).

When do students have to maintain full-time enrollment and on-ground presence during the summer?

You are required to maintain full-time enrollment and on-ground presence during the summer term(s) if:

It is your first term of enrollment at NU and you have an Initial or Transfer I-20/DS-2019
It is your first term of enrollment after an approved change of degree level (CDL) or change of status (COS)
It is your final academic term
It is required for all students in your degree program
You are returning to NU after a leave of absence

If you are required to maintain full-time enrollment during the summer term you must follow all requirements found on the Maintaining Status page of the OGS website.

Summer enrollment in your first term

If the summer term is your first term of enrollment at Northeastern, or your first term after an approved CDL or COS, you must maintain full-time enrollment and appropriate on-ground presence for the duration of the summer term(s). Please note:

If you begin your program begin in summer 1 you are not eligible for a vacation period in summer 2
If your program begins in summer 2 (student athletes, Doctorate of Physical Therapy students, etc.), please consult directly with your academic advisor for requirements on full time enrollment

You can maintain your F-1 or J-1 status according to the Guidelines on Maintaining Status provided by OGS.

Summer enrollment in your final term

If the summer is your final term of enrollment at Northeastern and you are not completing your program overseas, you must maintain full time enrollment with appropriate on-ground presence throughout the duration of your final term (full summer, summer 1, summer 2, or the summer quarter). Please note that students who complete their program during summer 2 may elect to utilize summer 1 as a vacation term.

For F-1 Students completing in summer 1: Your I-20 end date will be shortened to reflect the end of summer 1
For J-1 Students completing in summer 1: Your DS-2019 end date will be shortened to reflect the end of summer 1 if you do not plan to apply for post-completion Academic Training (AT)
All CPS graduate students completing in the summer quarter must maintain full-time enrollment and on-ground presence for the duration of the quarter

As students in their final term before graduation may be eligible for a final term reduced course load (RCL), please review the “Final Term” guidelines provided by OGS to understand how to maintain your student status.

Summer Travel

If you plan to travel during the summer term, please review all the travel guidance provided by OGS.

If I maintain full-time enrollment with on-ground presence during the summer term(s) can this term be considered as accrued time toward eligibility for F-1/J-1 benefits for work authorization?

Some benefits require you to have been enrolled full-time in F-1 or J-1 status for a certain number of semesters/quarters in order to be eligible. You may count the summer term towards this requirement if you are enrolled full-time in the full summer or in the summer quarter; part-time summer enrollment and enrollment in summer 1 or summer 2 only cannot be counted towards eligibility for these benefits.

If the summer is not required for me, can I still enroll in classes?

Yes! You may enroll in both in-person and online courses at your leisure. However, if you plan to engage in any practical training opportunities, you must receive employment authorization.
How do I know if I need to submit a Change of Degree Level (CDL) request?

If you are a current, continuing student at Northeastern and you will be starting a new program at Northeastern, you must submit a Change of Degree Level e-form request to myOGS prior to starting the new program. Once the request is approved, OGS will issue you a new Form I-20/DS-2019 that reflects the new degree program.
Please note: this does NOT apply to Bachelor’s degree level students who are simply changing their major. For Bachelor’s degree level changes of major, please submit the I-20 Request for Continuing Students.
Below you will find a list of scenarios that would require submitting a Change of Degree Level (CDL) request to OGS:

Change from Global Scholars to Bachelor’s degree level
Change from pathway program to Bachelor’s degree level
Change from Bachelor’s degree level to Master’s degree level
Change from Bachelor’s degree level to Graduate Certificate program
Change from one Master’s degree program to another Master’s degree program (either after completing the first, or without completing)
Change from Graduate Certificate program to Master’s degree program
Change from Master’s degree program to Graduate Certificate program
Change from Master’s degree program to PhD degree program (either after completing the Master’s, or without completing)
Change from PhD degree program to Master’s degree program (i.e. if you are not able to complete the PhD, or choose to graduate with a Master’s instead of completing the PhD)
All PlusOne programs (before starting the graduate portion of the program)

When do I need to submit the CDL request?

You must submit a Change of Degree Level e-form request to myOGS prior to starting the new program, and no later than 60 days after the program end date listed on the I-20 for your current/previous degree program. This is technically your 60-day grace period.
After the 60 days, if no action is taken on your SEVIS record, the record will automatically complete. If you do not submit your CDL request in a timely manner, you will no longer be eligible for a CDL I-20, and will need to depart the U.S. immediately and request a new Initial I-20 to return for the new degree program.
Please also note that the start term for your new degree program must be the earliest possible start term, no later than 5 months after you complete or end your previous program.

Requirements to Submit the CDL Request

In order to submit the Change of Degree Level e-form, you will need to:

Have a passport that remains valid at least 6 months into the future
Already be admitted and pay the enrollment deposit (if required) for your new academic program
Demonstrate that you have sufficient financial resources for at least one academic year of your new degree program. You can find the estimated expenses here. Financial documentation must meet the requirements.

New CDL I-20 and Immigration Clearance

Once your change of degree level request is processed by OGS, you will receive a new I-20 with the same SEVIS ID number reflecting the new degree information.
Please note that you will be required to submit an Immigration Clearance again for this new degree.

Enrollment after a CDL

Your first term on the new CDL I-20 is considered your first term in a new program – therefore it is a required term. This means that you must maintain full-time enrollment with appropriate on-ground presence, even if it is the summer term.

Full-time enrollment is as follows:

Undergraduate: minimum of 12 credit hours per term
Graduate: minimum of 8 credit hours per term (9 credit hours per term in a 3-credit enrollment system)
Graduate students who hold an assistantship: minimum of 6 credit hours per term

You can learn more about maintaining full-time enrollment and appropriate on-ground presence on the Guidelines on Maintaining Status page.

Travel and Change of Degree Level

You can remain in the U.S. in the time between degree programs, as long as you request the CDL in a timely manner following the deadlines explained in the section above.
If you depart the U.S. after the program end date on the I-20 for your previous degree program, you will need to wait until you receive the new CDL I-20 for your new degree program to enter the U.S.
As your SEVIS ID and school name on your CDL I-20 as your previous I-20, your previously issued F-1 visa should remain valid for travel as long as it has not expired.

Employment and Change of Degree Level

On-Campus Employment

You may continue any on-campus employment during the time between degree levels only if you have received the Change of Degree level I-20.

OPT & STEM OPT Employment

Once your change of degree level I-20 is processed, you will no longer be eligible to apply for Post-Completion OPT based on the previous degree.
If you are currently on an approved period of OPT/STEM OPT and you receive a new change of degree level I-20, you must stop your OPT/STEM employment as of the new I-20 start date, regardless of whether your EAD card will have validity after that date.

Final term enrollment

Degree-seeking students who are in their final academic term of their program of study may not need a full-time course load to complete the requirements for their degree; if this is the case, they may be eligible for a Final Term Reduced Courseload (RCL). Students in this situation may be eligible to enroll in less than a full course-load during their final term (this includes students completing their program during one of the available summer terms) as long as all of the following criteria are met:

Students must maintain appropriate on-ground presence for the duration of their final term via enrollment in on-ground classes

Students may not enroll in courses that only occur in the first session of the term and have no course enrollment in second session of the term

Students may not enroll in only online classes

The only exception is for students who intend to finish their program online from overseas
Please also refer to the limitations on online course enrollment

Students must enroll in all remaining courses needed to complete their academic program
Students must understand that the end date on their I-20 will be updated to align with their final term of enrollment

Students who complete their program in Summer 1 will have an I-20/DS-2019 end date that reflects the end of the Summer 1 term; it will not reflect the degree conferral date which occurs at the end of the summer

No SEVIS authorization from OGS is needed for a Final Term RCL, though we do advise students to confirm with their academic advisor that all graduation requirements have been met.
All students in their final term must notify OGS by submitting the Intent to Complete Program form within 30 days after the start of their final term! This e-form alerts OGS to shorten a student’s I-20/DS-2019 if your end date occurs in a future term. Remember, your I-20/DS-2019 end date must correspond with your final term of enrollment.

I am in my last academic term. Can I take all online courses?

No, you must follow the instructions in this section for maintaining status in your last term. If your program offers enough online courses for you to complete your degree program online, you could leave the U.S. and take your remaining courses from abroad. If you choose to do this, you should let the Office of Global Services know so that we can terminate your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record. Please note that if you do this, you will not be eligible for Optional Practical Training after this degree and if you wish to attend your graduation ceremony, you would need to return on a tourist visa.

If my final term is in the summer can I take my last course online?

No, even if your last course is taking place during a summer vacation period you must still maintain an on-ground presence.

Do I have to tell the Office of Global Services that I'm dropping below full-time in my final semester?

No, the Office of Global Services does not have to be told if you are dropping below full-time. Just make sure that you are also maintaining on-ground presence.
What is a program extension?

International students who need additional time to complete their degree requirements must apply for an extension of their I-20 or DS-2019. In order to maintain their status, they must apply for this extension before their current I-20 or DS-2019 program end date. Students receive an I-20 or DS-2019 based on Northeastern University’s program objectives, which account for any college approved experiential learning that is built into the length of the program of study.

Eligibility requirements

Submit the completed program extension request to the Office of Global Services (OGS) at least 30 days prior to the program end date on your most recent I-20 or DS-2019
Continually maintained valid F-1 or J-1 status
The delay in program completion is caused by compelling academic or medical reasons, such as:

Change of major or research topics
Unexpected research problems
Thesis/Dissertation continuation
Documented illnesses – A reduced course load or medical leave must have been granted by the University Health & Counseling Services (UHCS)
Other documented academic circumstances*

*Program extension requests are subject to review by OGS. Students will be notified of the status of their request after OGS completes review.

Resolve any financial holds on your myNortheastern account before submitting the program extension request to OGS

The following reasons are not acceptable for a program extension:

Enrolling in additional courses to improve GPA or for personal interest that is not required for program completion;
Engaging in supplemental on or off campus research that is not required for program completion;
Finishing outstanding coursework for an incomplete grade from a previous term;
Retaking a failed class that is not required for program completion;
Engaging in supplemental experiential learning experience/practical training experience that is not necessary or integral for program completion.
Completing requirements for a minor

According to the Northeastern academic catalog  “Students must fulfill all requirements for the minor and major concurrently and may not extend their program of study to complete a minor.“

How to request a program extension

If you are unable to complete your program of study before the program end date on your I-20 or DS-2019, you must apply to OGS for a program extension at least 30 days before the program end date on your I-20 or DS-2019. Please complete and submit the Program Extension Request.

Am I able to get a program extension after my I-20 program end date has passed?

No, after your program end date has passed, OGS is no longer able to extend your program. If you believe that you will need a program extension, please make sure that you apply with OGS well in advance. Not extending before your program end date will result in you losing valid F or J status and require corrective action at considerable expense to a student and potential loss of F-1 or J-1 benefits.

What is a SEVIS Transfer?

A SEVIS transfer is the process of moving your SEVIS record from your current school (Northeastern) to another SEVP-certified school in the U.S. after you’ve received an offer of admission.
If you are an F-1 or J-1 student who is leaving or completing your current degree program or ending a period of approved Post-OPT/STEM OPT/AT, you may be eligible to request a SEVIS transfer. Please review eligibility requirements and the process to request a SEVIS transfer on this page.

How Students Fall Out of Status

An F-1 student may fall out of status for a violation of F-1 federal regulations.
There are many reasons why a student may fall out of status, including but not limited to:

Dropping below full-time enrollment without prior authorization
Enrolling in too many online courses
Not maintaining on-ground presence
Letting the I-20 program end date expire without requesting a program extension in a timely manner
Working without authorization from the Office of Global Services (OGS)
Taking a leave of absence without permission from the college and OGS
Not making normal and continuous progress towards the completion of their program

The Office of Global Services must terminate the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record of a student who is out of status in order to comply with Federal government regulations.
OGS advisors will work with students to attempt to remedy the violation. Please schedule an appointment with a Designated School Official/DSO (F-1 students) or Alternate Responsible Officer/ARO (J-1 students) at OGS by calling 617-373-2310 or visiting the front desk in 354 Richards Hall in Boston.

Two Ways to Correct F-1 Status

In order to resume studies in valid F-1 status, a student must seek to regain status of one of the following ways. Use the drop-down buttons below to learn about the different types, and then call OGS to schedule an appointment to discuss how to move forward.
If you wish to consult with an attorney, please see this List of Personal Immigration Attorneys and Pro-Bono Legal Services.

F-1 Reinstatement

You may be eligible if you have been out of status for less than five months, are currently in the U.S., and can demonstrate that the violation of status was out of your control.
To correct your visa status through reinstatement, students must obtain the support of OGS and a reinstatement I-20 from the OGS and file an application for reinstatement with the U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services (USCIS). Not all students who are out of status are eligible to go through reinstatement.

F-1 Readmission

This process is for eligible students with a terminated SEVIS record who have departed or plan to immediately depart the U.S.
In order to correct your visa status through readmission, students must obtain a new initial I-20 with a new the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record, leave the country, and re-enter using the new initial I-20.

If you have completed one academic program and plan to start another the following semester/quarter and you have the I-20 or DS-2019 for your new program, then you may travel without getting a travel signature on the I-20 or DS-2019 for your new program.

How can I renew my passport?

Contact or check the website of your country’s nearest embassy or consulate in the U.S. to learn about the process for renewing your passport.

I will renew my passport but my student visa is still valid and is in my old passport. What should I do?

When you travel, carry both the new passport and the old passport with your student visa if your country of nationality allows you to keep your old passport. If your country does not allow you to keep your old passport containing a valid F-1 or J-1 visa, you will need to apply for a new visa the next time you travel abroad.

I need to return home during a required term. How long can I be outside of the U.S.?

A huge part of your responsibility of maintaining your F-1/J-1 status is by actively participating in classes in person. This includes students who are engaging in practical training (co-op, internships, clinical rotations, etc.). All students must also adhere to their college’s attendance and absenteeism policy. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1/J-1 student be absent from their courses for an extended period during the academic term. As an international student, this prolonged absence may impact your F-1/J-1 status and your long-term academic goals.
If you are unable to attend your classes in person, you may be advised to pursue a leave of absence from your studies.
What you need when traveling in the U.S.

A valid passport. The passport should be valid for at least six months after your date of entry to the U.S.
Form I-20 (F visa) or DS-2019 (J visa)
Print your most recent I-94 which is your arrival/departure record

Any family members traveling with you who have F-2 or J-2 visas should carry the same documents.
Northeastern University requires all students and highly recommends that all faculty and staff enter their travel itinerary and housing accommodations into “My Travel Plans,” also called the “Travel Registry.”
This allows the university to communicate directly with travelers if unexpected events or conditions create circumstances that might pose health or safety risks. In addition, it enables on-campus resources and external support providers to better respond to students, faculty, and staff who may need medical or security assistance.

Getting Started

There are many reasons why students choose to engage in study abroad opportunities during their degree programs. You can find more information on available study abroad programs and how to connect with a Global Experience Advisor on the GEO website. After confirming admission to a study abroad program, you will need to follow up with OGS to request an I-20 for study abroad.

When Should You Request An I-20 for Study Abroad

After you receive your Letter of Enrollment from GEO or the sponsoring Northeastern University Academic Department, you should request an I-20 for study abroad from OGS.​ You should request the updated I-20 before leaving the U.S. to participate in your study abroad program.

Who Needs an I-20 for Study Abroad

F-1 students studying abroad during the academic year​ will require an updated I-20 with a study abroad remark. Your updated I-20 will be signed for travel and is valid for one year. Please be aware of your program end date on the page 1 of the I-20. If your program end date will occur in less than one year, your travel signature is valid only until the program end date listed on your I-20.

What You Will Need

You must have a “Letter of Enrollment” from the Global Experience Office or from the academic department at Northeastern University that is sponsoring the study abroad which confirms the following:

Exact dates of study abroad.
Location (institution, city, country) of study abroad.

After you obtain the letter, please go to Request for SEVIS I-20/DS-2019.
Please note:

A letter from your host institution abroad or other agency/company will not be acceptable.
If you study abroad only during the summer term, you do not need to request a study abroad I-20.

Maintaining Status While Studying Abroad

You are required to maintain full-time enrollment in order to maintain your F-1 immigration status while studying abroad. Any changes in enrollment during your study abroad program could affect your ability to return to the U.S.

Re-entering the United States

At the conclusion of your study abroad program, you should prepare the following documents to re-enter the U.S. and resume your studies at Northeastern University:

Passport
Valid F-1 U.S. entry visa
Form I-20 with study abroad remark and travel signature
Copy of your “Letter of Enrollment” from GEO or from the academic department at Northeastern University that is sponsoring the study abroad program
Additional information on Arriving in the U.S. can be found on the OGS website

Please note:

If your F-1 U.S. entry visa is expired or will expire while studying overseas, you will need to apply for a new visa before making travel plans to return to the US.  If the visa application is denied, you must obtain a new visa in your home country to return to the U.S.

Executive order timeline

January 29, 2018 – Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rules against third travel ban
During the first week in December, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on President Trump’s third travel ban. On Dec. 22, 2017, the Ninth Circuit issued a decision that partially blocked the third travel ban. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the travel ban will not be enforced against “foreign nationals who have a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.” The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in December, however, supersedes the Ninth Circuit’s decision. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the Trump administration could fully implement and enforce the third travel ban on all eight countries. On Jan. 6, 2018, the Trump administration petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Ninth Circuit’s decision, which the U.S. Supreme Court granted on Jan. 19.  The U.S. Supreme Court will consider 4 questions:

Whether courts can review a challenge to the travel ban executive order at all;
Whether the executive order falls within the president’s authority over immigration;
Whether the Hawaii district court’s order applies too broadly; and
Whether the executive order violates the Constitution’s establishment clause

At this time, the Fourth Circuit has not issued a decision. Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available.  Please contact the Office of Global Services if you have any questions.
December 8, 2017 – USA Supreme Court allows Trump to enforce travel ban until lower courts rule on challenges
The U.S. Supreme Court issued an order on Dec. 4, 2017, allowing the Trump administration to implement fully and enforce its newest travel ban while lower courts continue to consider challenges to it.
Travel restrictions, which vary by country, will affect certain nationals of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen, unless exempt or granted a waiver pursuant to a presidential proclamation that was issued on Sept. 24.
The Trump administration had previously been barred from implementing the ban on its intended effective date of Oct. 18, 2017, after two lower federal courts issued injunctions that temporarily enjoined enforcement of most of the ban’s restrictions. Following the Trump administration’s appeal of those rulings and request for temporary permission to implement the proclamation, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the ban to take effect partially, but exempted travelers with a bona fide relationship to a person or entity in the United States. The Dec. 4 order by the Supreme Court removes the relationship exemption and allows the Trump administration to implement the ban fully while challenges continue in the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and the Ninth Circuits.
Specific travel restrictions
Effective Dec. 8, 2017, the Trump administration will fully implement the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dec. 4, 2017, order, and nationals of the eight countries will be subject to the following U.S. travel limitations, unless otherwise exempt:
• Chad: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas
• Iran: No nonimmigrant visas except F and M student visas and J exchange visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas
• Libya: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas
• North Korea: No nonimmigrant, immigrant, or diversity lottery visas
• Somalia: Nonimmigrant visa applicants subject to heightened scrutiny; no immigrant or diversity visas
• Syria: No nonimmigrant, immigrant, or diversity lottery visas
• Venezuela: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visas for officials of designated Venezuelan government agencies; other visa holders are subject to verification of traveler information; no restrictions on immigrant or diversity lottery visas
• Yemen: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas
Exemptions and waivers
Several classes of foreign nationals are exempt from the restrictions, including U.S. lawful permanent residents, dual nationals traveling on a passport from a non-restricted country, foreign nationals who hold a valid U.S. visa or advance parole, and those who were physically in the United States on the applicable original effective date of the travel restrictions.
Those who are not exempt may request a waiver when applying for a visa. To be eligible for a waiver, a foreign national must demonstrate that he or she would suffer undue hardship if denied entry, and that his or her entry would not pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety and would be in U.S. national interest. Waivers are discretionary and may be difficult to obtain.
What this means for travelers
Foreign nationals who are currently in the United States, hold a passport from a restricted country (other than exempt dual nationals), and would need to apply for a visa to reenter the United States should carefully consider the risks of international travel and the potential for significant delays.
As a reminder, all foreign nationals—including those exempt from the travel restrictions—are subject to national security screening and the potential for additional vetting when applying for a U.S. visa or admission to the United States.
Looking ahead
The travel restrictions will be implemented while the Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeal continue to hear challenges to the presidential proclamation. The Ninth Circuit is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Dec. 6, 2017, while the Fourth Circuit is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Dec. 8, 2017.
Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available. Please contact the university’s Office of Global Services at [email protected] if you have any questions.
October 26, 2017 – The Department of Homeland Security began requiring airlines to implement enhanced security measures for flights destined to the USA
These enhanced security measures include enhanced screening of passengers and their electronic devices as well as an increase in security standards for aircrafts and airports. More information on the new security standards can be found in the DHS Fact Sheet: Aviation Enhanced Security Measures for All Commercial Flights to the United States.
September 27, 2017 – Country-specific travel ban issued
President Trump issued a proclamation that imposes new travel restrictions on eight countries. Five of the eight countries—Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen—were included in the previous travel ban, while three countries—Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela—were added to the revised list.
The new restrictions were issued on Sept. 24, 2017, just as the old 90-day travel ban expired, and will go into effect on Oct. 18. Until then, by virtue of the proclamation, the “old” travel ban will continue for individuals from those countries still on the list who do not have a bona fide relationship with a U.S. person or entity.
The new restrictions will not be applied to:

Current lawful permanent residents
Current visa holders
Dual nationals traveling on a passport from an unaffected country
Asylees
Refugees already admitted to the U.S.
Individuals granted protection under the Convention Against Torture

Restrictions by country:
Chad, Libya, and Yemen:
Entry as immigrants and non immigrants in business and tourist status is suspended.
Iran:
Entry as immigrants and nonimmigrants is suspended, except for those in valid student (F and M) or exchange visitor (J) status.
Syria and North Korea:
Entry as immigrants or nonimmigrants is suspended.
Venezuela:
Entry in tourist or business visitor status is suspended for officials of certain government agencies involved in screening and vetting practices and their immediate family members.
Somalia:
Entry as immigrants is suspended and decisions regarding entry as non immigrants will be subject to additional scrutiny.
Although Iraq is not technically covered by the new restrictions, the proclamation notes that Iraqi nationals will be subject to additional scrutiny.
How long these restrictions will last is uncertain. Countries may be removed or added to the list based upon further review of the effectiveness of their security practices.
Waivers will be available on “undue hardship” grounds if a consulate determines the entry would not pose a threat to national security and the admission would be in the national interest. This could include individuals who have already been admitted to the U.S. for extended periods of time.
The Supreme Court was set to hear the travel ban case on Oct. 10. The justices canceled that hearing and asked the parties to submit new briefs by Oct. 5.
Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available. Please contact the university’s Office of Global Services if you have any questions.
March 8, 2017
President Trump has signed a revised executive order that will suspend the entry of nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for a period of 90 days beginning March 16 at 12:01 a.m. ET. The new order rescinds the president’s Jan. 27 travel ban, which a federal court suspended last month. The new travel restrictions will be in effect through June 14, 2017. However, the order indicates that ban could be extended and additional countries could be subject to restrictions.
Who is subject to the revised executive order?
The executive order prohibits nationals of the six restricted countries from entering the United States unless they qualify for an exemption or are granted a waiver. Iraqi nationals are no longer included in the ban. The order also suspends the admission of refugees from any country, including Syria, for 120 days as of March 16.
The following classes of foreign nationals will be exempt from the ban:

U.S. lawful permanent residents (green card holders)
Holders of a valid U.S. visa, even if they have not yet used it (Visas that were provisionally revoked under the Jan. 27 executive order should be valid for travel. Foreign nationals with a visa that was physically cancelled under the Jan. 27 executive order may be entitled to a new travel document for entry to the U.S.)
Dual nationals traveling on a valid passport from a non-restricted country (Dual nationals must hold a valid U.S. visa or be visa-exempt.)
Foreign nationals holding a valid advance parole document
Foreign nationals holding a valid A, C-2, G, or NATO visa
Foreign nationals granted asylum
Refugees already admitted to the U.S. and those with travel formally scheduled by the State Department

Once the order is in effect, non-exempt nationals of the restricted countries will be prohibited from entering the U.S. for the duration of the ban unless they are granted a waiver.
Until the new executive order takes effect, the Department of State indicates that it will continue to process visa applications from nationals of the six restricted countries. However, applicants should be prepared for lengthy security screening and the possibility that they may not be issued a visa before the entry ban takes effect.
Waivers of the entry ban
The executive order permits the Departments of Homeland Security and State to grant discretionary waivers of the entry ban. Waiver applicants must show that a denial of entry would cause undue hardship and that their entry is in the national interest and would not pose a threat to national security.
The executive order suggests that a waiver may be appropriate for several classes of foreign nationals, including: (1) individuals previously admitted to the U.S. for a continuous period of work, study, or another long-term activity who are seeking to resume that activity; (2) individuals with previously established significant contacts with the U.S.; (3) individuals with significant business or professional obligations in the U.S.; (4) individuals seeking to visit or reside with a close family member; (5) individuals who are infants, young children or adoptees, or needing urgent medical care, or otherwise justified by the special circumstances; (6) individuals employed by or on behalf of the U.S. government; (7) individuals who are permanent Canadian residents applying for a visa in Canada; and (8) individuals traveling as a U.S. government-sponsored exchange visitor. Given the stringent criteria, however, waivers may be difficult to obtain.
Processing of immigration applications and petitions
The executive order limits the Department of State interview waiver program for nonimmigrant visa applicants. Though foreign nationals from non-restricted countries may still qualify for an exemption from an in-person visa interview, visa applicants should check the website of the relevant U.S. consulate for specific information, which is subject to frequent change.
In addition to the entry ban, the president has issued a memorandum directing the Departments of Homeland Security, State, and Justice to implement more stringent vetting of applications and petitions for immigration benefits. Enhanced security screening could take effect quickly, and may delay processing at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and at U.S. consulates.
March 17, 2017 – Federal courts in Hawaii, Maryland temporarily block revised travel ban.
On March 15, one day before President Trump’s revised executive order was slated to go into effect, the U.S. District Court in Hawaii issued a nationwide temporary block preventing the government from enforcing or implementing Section 2 (90-day travel ban) and Section 6 (120-day U.S. refugee program suspension) of the revised order.
Also, early on March 16, the U.S. District Court in Maryland issued a separate ruling barring enforcement nationwide of the 90-day travel ban.
Other sections of the revised executive order not included in the court’s decision became effective at 12:01 a.m. ET on March 16, including Section 5 (uniform screening and vetting standards for all immigration programs), Section 7 (rescission of exercise of authority relating to terrorism grounds of inadmissibility), Section 8 (expedited completion of biometric entry-exit tracking system), Section 9 (visa interview security), and Section 10 (visa validity reciprocity).
The U.S. Department of State announced that due to the litigation, U.S. embassies and consulates will continue to process visas for nationals of the six targeted countries. Nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen may continue to travel into the U.S. for the immediate future, if otherwise admissible.
The university continues to follow the situation closely and will update this page as further information becomes available. Please contact the Office of Global Services if you have any questions.
August 8, 2017 – State Department updates policy guidance on F-1 student visa applications
On Aug. 8, the Department of State revised its guidance to consular officers when considering F-1 student visas. The modification provides assistance to consular officers in determining whether an F-1 visa applicant plans to leave the United States after graduation. Due to these changes, students applying for F-1 visas may be asked additional questions regarding their long-term plans and their ties to their home country. The revised policy guidelines can be found here: https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM040205.html. Northeastern will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available about the revised guidance. Please contact the Office of Global Services if you have any questions.
August 28, 2017 – In-person interviews for employment-based green card applicants to begin Oct. 1
Beginning on Oct. 1, in-person interviews will be required for all applicants seeking an employment-based green card. In the past, in-person interviews could be waived if no additional information was needed. Citizenship and Immigration Services stated that the in-person interviews will allow officers to verify information in applications, discover new relevant information, and assist with evaluating the credibility of applicants. More information about the in-person interviews can be found here: https://www.uscis.gov/news/news-releases/uscis-to-expand-in-person-interview-requirements-for-certain-permanent-residency-applicants.
September 1, 2017 – State Department replaces “30/60 Day Rule”
On Sept. 1, the Department of State eliminated the “30/60 Day Rule” regarding adjustment of status applications. This rule assisted officials in determining whether an individual would be inadmissible due to inconsistent conduct. The “90 Day Rule” replaced the prior rule and applies to both immigrant and non-immigrant visa applicants. The new rule provides individuals seeking an adjustment of status less flexibility to postpone filings. The “90 Day Rule” can be found here: https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM030209.html.
September 13, 2017 – Trump Administration imposes visa sanctions on four countries
On Sept. 13, the Trump administration imposed visa sanctions on Cambodia, Eritrea, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. According to officials, these four countries have refused to accept or have unreasonably delayed accepting deportees who have been convicted of crimes in the United States. Not all visas have been discontinued. The Department of Homeland Security’s announcement regarding the specific visa sanctions can be found here: https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/13/dhs-announces-implementation-visa-sanctions-four-countries.

February 9, 2017 –USA 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled to continue blocking President Trump’s travel ban
The unanimous decision temporarily keeps in place a stay preventing a ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.
The Department of Homeland Security has directed its agency to adjudicate applications and petitions filed for or on behalf of individuals in the U.S., regardless of their country of origin. Also, all U.S. ports of entry will resume admission of non-immigrant and immigrant visa holders, including refugees, according to policies and procedures existing prior to the Executive Order.
The Court of Appeals instructed attorneys for each party to file briefs by 11 a.m. on Thursday, Feb. 16, arguing whether the government’s motion for a stay should be considered again by the entire appeals court. To hold a rehearing, a majority of the 29 active judges on the court would need to vote in favor of that motion.
We will continue to provide updates on the pending litigation. Please contact the Office of Global Services  or We Care  if you have any questions.
February 5, 2017 –President Aoun’s Statement
“To all members of the Northeastern University community:
For the past decade, we have joined together to make Northeastern a truly global university. In doing so, we have set forth a series of core values such as the value of inclusivity and a bedrock belief that diversity makes our community stronger.
I find the president’s executive order restricting international travel to be antithetical to our core values and completely unacceptable. I say this as an educator and as an American who came to this country as an international student.
Throughout the past week, I have had the opportunity to speak to many in our community who are directly affected by this new reality. I have listened to their stories and seen the anxiety etched in their faces.
To the 250 Northeastern students and 31 faculty and staff impacted by this executive order: Your story is my story. You have my unwavering pledge that your university will stand by you, safeguard you, and be your home away from home. To my faculty and staff colleagues: Ensuring that all in our community can achieve their dreams without disruption is our highest priority. It is an honor to work with you on this charge.
As we all know, Northeastern never stands idly by, observing from the sidelines. On Friday, we joined seven other leading universities in filing an amicus brief in federal court. Our brief makes clear that the executive order imperils our ability to have students and scholars collaborate and advance knowledge across borders. The order represents a threat to the mission of global higher education.
In the aftermath of this executive order, it has become abundantly clear that the integration of diverse people, ideas, and cultures—which universities like Northeastern make possible—is more important than ever before.
Let us turn this challenge into opportunity. Together, we will seize this moment to reaffirm our core values and strengthen our commitment to being a diverse, inclusive, and truly global university.
I look forward to achieving this important work together.
Sincerely,
Joseph E. Aoun
President”

Understanding the Executive Order and Implications for Our Community
Wednesday, Feb. 8, 10-11:30 a.m., Curry Student Center Ballroom
Faculty and staff from Northeastern’s School of Law, Office of General Counsel, Office of Global Services, as well as local immigration attorneys will provide an overview of what the Executive Order is, the implications behind the stay, the appeal process, and what this all means for Northeastern community members. The panel will discuss the differences between status adjustments (such as program extension or CPT) at the university level versus adjudications that need to be done by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
February 4, 2017 – USA Citizenship and Immigration Services Update
For students concerned about applying for Optional Practical Training (OPT), the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services continues to adjudicate applications and petitions filed on behalf of individuals in the United States regardless of their country of origin, and applications and petitions of lawful permanent residents outside the U.S. Applications to adjust status also continue to be adjudicated, according to existing policies and procedures, for applicants who are nationals of countries designated in the Jan. 27, 2017, “Executive Order: Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.”
February 4, 2017 – No Current Plans to Expand Travel Ban Beyond Current Countries
The Department of State confirmed that there is no addendum, annex, or amendment now being worked on to expand visa revocations or the travel ban to countries other than those currently implicated in the Executive Order.
February 4, 2017 – Clarification from DHS and DOS re: Implementation of Executive Order on Immigration
On Friday, Feb. 3, and effective immediately, a federal judge in Seattle issued a ruling that temporarily blocks President Trump’s week-old immigration order from being enforced nationwide.
Following the decision, the Department of Homeland Security said it has suspended all actions to implement the president’s immigration order. The department will resume inspections of travelers as it did prior to the signing of the executive order, according to a DHS statement.
Meanwhile, the State Department said it has reversed the cancellation of visas that were provisionally revoked following the travel ban—so long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled.
According to Customs and Border Protection, individuals who had their visas physically canceled as a result of the executive order will not need to reapply for a new visa. Absent any other admissibility issues, those individuals will receive an I-193 waiver (Application for Waiver of Passport and/or Visa) upon arrival to the U.S. For those traveling by air, airlines have been instructed to contact Customs and Border Protection to receive authorization to permit boarding.
On Sunday, Feb. 5, a federal appeals court rejected a request by the Justice Department to immediately restore the executive order.
We continue to monitor all legal and implementation decisions related to the executive order and will provide information as it becomes available.
February 1, 2017 – Travel Alert Under President Trump’s Immigration Executive Order
On January 27, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order suspending immigrant and non-immigrant admissions to the U.S. for at least 90 days for individuals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The Executive Order did not specifically categorize what categories of “individuals” (i.e., the definition of “individuals from”) are subject to the ban. This broad generalization has led to widespread confusion at ports of entry across the U.S., but since then the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has stated that travelers will be treated according to the travel document (passport) they present at the border. See https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/01/29/protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states
Federal judges in several jurisdictions issued court rulings to stay the terms of the Executive Order that would have led to the removal of foreign nationals who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa or status as a lawful permanent resident (green card holder). These stays remain in effect but may be temporary. These court orders also do not apply to airports with pre-clearance facilities (Dublin & Shannon, Ireland; Aruba; Freeport & Nassau, The Bahamas; Bermuda; Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; and Calgary, Toronto, Edmonton, Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Vancouver, and Winnipeg, Canada). Nationals of the seven affected countries should avoid flying into the U.S. from these airports. These court orders do not mean that anyone arriving with a visa is guaranteed entry. People with a non-immigrant (temporary) visa from those 7 countries will be denied entry unless they can show that their admission is in the national interest and they do not pose a security threat.
Citizens of the affected countries who hold dual citizenship with the U.S. should not be directly affected. Non-U.S. citizens who hold dual citizenship with the affected countries and one other foreign country may be subject to the ban. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant deemed a threat to national security or public safety.
This ban may include individuals who have traveled to one or more of the designated countries as well, even if they do not hold a nationality of one of the designated countries. Additional screening for those who have been in these countries should be expected, including the search and examination of luggage, mobile phones, computers, and electronics, including social media pages for any anti-American communications or posts.
Green card holders returning to the U.S. after a short time abroad have the legal right to return to the U.S., barring exceptional circumstances. On January 29, 2017, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security released a statement that “the entry of lawful permanent residents” is in the national interest.
Further, U.S. Embassies and Consulates across the world have been instructed not to issue any non-immigrant or immigrant visas to persons from the affected countries, consistent with the Executive Order. Also, individuals from one of the affected countries who have a pending immigration petition or application with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may experience delays in the adjudication of their cases.
The Executive Order also contemplates that additional countries could be added to the banned list.  Accordingly, until more information becomes available, and given the possibility of a change in government policy that could go into effect immediately, all foreign nationals should carefully assess whether it is worth the risk to travel outside the United States. We recommend that international students and scholars should not travel outside of the U.S. without speaking with an advisor at the Office of Global Services (OGS) and/or seeking advice from personal legal counsel who can review individual circumstances for potential available options or possible relief from the consequences of the Executive Order. The OGS can provide you with a list of personal immigration attorneys and a list of pro bono service providers.
The OGS is working with offices and key stakeholders throughout the university to offer resources and support for international students and scholars.
Joseph Aoun, President of Northeastern University, sent a message to the entire Northeastern community on January 28, 2017, stating: “Let us strengthen our resolve to be a welcoming community that embraces the immeasurable benefits of diversity and inclusion. All in our community—especially those who feel vulnerable as a result of this new paradigm—should feel safe and secure at Northeastern. We, the leadership of the university, stand with you and will pursue every means available to safeguard each of you—students, faculty, and staff.”
This alert is not legal advice. We will continue to provide updated information and guidance as it becomes available.

Medical Leave of Absence (MLOA) Overview

Updated 12/14/2023

OGS understands that a medical issue or illness can be a source of anxiety for our students. We are here to support you during this difficult time. Please review the information below and be sure to follow all the steps so that you continue to be compliant with the requirements of your student visa.
If you are considering pursuing a Medical Leave of Absence (MLOA) please follow each of the steps below:

Apply for a MLOA through the University Health and Counseling Services (UHCS). Information on applying for a MLOA can be found at the website of the University Health and Counseling Services.

F-1 Students

Most F-1 students will be required to depart the U.S. for the duration of their MLOA. OGS will terminate your I-20 for “Authorized Early Withdrawal” and you will be advised to either request a new Initial I-20 or request reactivation when you have been approved by UHCS for re-entry.
In limited circumstances, F-1 students may qualify to take their MLOA from inside the U.S.

To qualify to take a MLOA from inside the U.S., federal regulations require that you provide supporting documentation to OGS that is signed by one of the following U.S.-based medical professionals (no exceptions):

Medical Doctor, Psychiatrist, Doctor of Osteopathy, Licensed Psychologist, or Clinical Psychologist

A template letter is available here

J-1 Students

Please schedule an appointment with an Alternate Responsible Officer (ARO) in OGS to discuss your options

Schedule an appointment with a Designated School Official (DSO) in OGS. This can be done prior to the UHCS application or immediately following your UHCS application. A MLOA may carry serious consequences to your immigration status, and seeking guidance from an OGS advisor is an important part of the decision-making process.

To schedule an appointment with a DSO, please call 617-373-2310 or visit our front desk in Boston at 354 Richards Hall.

Complete the OGS MLOA Request e-form as early as possible. You do not need to have been approved for your MLOA to complete this form.

Additional Information

You must not withdraw from classes before OGS authorizes the MLOA in SEVIS. Failure to maintain full-time enrollment and on-ground presence while a request for MLOA is pending is a serious violation of F-1 status that will result in the termination of your SEVIS record. Students must maintain enrollment and class attendance until the MLOA is authorized in SEVIS.
UHCS may approve the MLOA for a full year. OGS is required to approve the MLOA in SEVIS each semester/term and updated medical documentation is required. It is the student’s responsibility to meet these requirements and submit a new MLOA e-form for each academic term in which they will be out on a MLOA.
A student may only be authorized for 365 days of a medical leave per degree level
Please click here to view a visual representation of your steps

You may view the FAQs in the sidebar for more information.
We recognize that this may be a stressful time for you. Please do not hesitate to contact OGS if you have additional questions.

Submit a MLOA Request

Please submit the Medical Leave of Absence Request e-form to inform OGS of your intention to take a MLOA. This e-form should be submitted as early as possible.

Returning from a MLOA

All students who have been approved for a MLOA must be approved for re-entry by University Health and Counseling Services.

You may learn more about requesting re-entry from a MLOA on the UHCS Website.

Once you’ve received approval for re-entry from UHCS, you must work with OGS to request an updated Form I-20.

If you spent the duration of your MLOA inside of the United States and have been approved to return by UHCS, please contact OGS to confirm that your immigration record does not need any adjustments.

To schedule an appointment with a DSO (F-1 students) or ARO (J-1 students), please call 617-373-2310 or visit our front desk.

If you spent the duration of your MLOA outside of the United States, please review the information found on Returning from a Leave of Absence Taken Outside of the U.S.

Frequently Asked Questions

×

What happens if my I-20 will expire while I’m on an approved MLOA inside the U.S.?

If your I-20 will expire while on an MLOA (see Program End Date), you must also request a program extension at least 30-days prior to the Program End Date.

What if I’m outside of the U.S. for more than 5-months during my MLOA?

A student who is outside of the U.S. for more than five months during an MLOA will need a new Initial I-20 for their return. Please be advised that this will reset your eligibility requirements for CPT/OPT. Please familiarize yourself with the five-month rule by visiting https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/2015/01/what-five-month-rule

How much total time may I be authorized for a MLOA?

A student can only be authorized for 365 days of medical leave per degree level. If you require more than 365 days of medical leave, you will need to notify OGS and make plans to depart the U.S. A new initial I-20 will be required to return to the U.S. (Please see instructions for obtaining a new initial I-20).

Can I request a MLOA for an academic term in the past?

No. The SEVIS system does not permit the authorization of a retroactive MLOA

Does OGS receive information about my medical condition?

The information regarding a student’s medical condition is not shared by UHCS with any other office. This information is confidential. However, should SEVP (the Student and Exchange Visitor Program) request to see your official doctor’s note, OGS may reach out to you to request your approval.
What is a Non-Medical Leave of Absence?

A Non-Medical Leave of Absence (NMLOA) refers to time during which a student interrupts their studies and departs the U.S. for personal reasons. An Emergency Leave (authorized by WeCare) is also considered a NMLOA. Conversely, a Medical Leave of Absence (MLOA) refers to a time during which a student interrupts their studies due to a documented medical condition. You can learn more about taking a MLOA here.
All students who take a leave of absence of any kind are responsible for reviewing and understanding institutional policies regarding withdrawing from courses in the Northeastern Course Catalog. Students must also follow all of their college/graduate school processes and notify the OGS prior to commencing their leave of absence.
Depending on the length of a NMLOA, a student’s eligibility for employment authorization (Curricular Practical Training/Optional Practical Training/Academic Training) may be affected, so it is important to schedule an appointment with an Designated School Official or DSO (F-1 students) or an Alternate Responsible Officer or ARO (J-1 students) to discuss your circumstances.

How to Request a Non-Medical Leave of Absence

Students must complete ALL of the following steps. Please note that steps 2 and 3 should be completed simultaneously.

1

Do not drop or withdraw from your classes prior to OGS confirming your eligibility!

All F/J students must continue to maintain full time enrollment with appropriate on-ground presence until they have been authorized by a DSO or ARO to drop below full-time enrollment requirements.

2

Schedule an appointment with an OGS Advisor and complete OGS' NMLOA e-form

All students seeking a NMLOA should make an appointment with a DSO/ARO in OGS to discuss how the leave will impact their SEVIS status and future eligibility for SEVIS benefits, such as Curricular Practical Training (CPT), Optional Practical Training (OPT), Academic Training (AT), etc.
Students must also complete OGS’ NMLOA e-form and should do this as early as possible. Students will be asked to add their advisor or secondary approver email to the e-form as a secondary approver.
To schedule an appointment with a DSO or ARO, please call +1-617-373-2310 or visit our front desk on the Boston campus at 354 Richards Hall.

3

Submit a personal leave request via the Registrar Forms link in the Student Hub

Students must make official arrangements for taking a leave of absence by submitting a leave request in the Student Hub. To learn more about the process for submitting the request in the Student Hub, review the Registrar’s knowledge-article on leaves of absence.
Students should also communicate and make arrangements with their academic advisor or graduate school office.

How to Return from a NMLOA?

Once you are ready to resume your studies at Northeastern University, you can review OGS’ instructions on Returning from a Leave of Absence.

Frequently Asked Questions

×

Can I stay in the U.S. if I take a non-medical leave of absence?

No. U.S. federal regulations require that all students taking a non-medical leave of absence spend the duration of their absence outside of the U.S.

If I stop attending classes before I notify OGS about my non-medical leave of absence, what will happen to my SEVIS record?

If you stop attending, drop, or withdraw from classes before notifying OGS, your SEVIS record will be terminated for unauthorized withdrawal. You will have to depart the U.S. immediately and will need to request a new Initial I-20 in order to return to your studies (you will not be eligible for Reactivation). When you return to the U.S. with a new Initial I-20, your F-1 status will begin again, and your eligibility clock for F-1/J-1 employment benefits (CPT/OPT/AT) will be reset.

What are the criteria for being eligible for “Reactivation” of my Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record?

Please review the “Returning from a Leave of Absence” page to see if you meet the criteria.

I am trying to decide whether a medical leave or non-medical leave would best fit my situation. How can I decide?

Please read the information regarding medical and non-medical leaves on our website. You will see that there are different federal regulations for each of these leaves. Then, make an appointment with a DSO/ARO in OGS to discuss your plans and available options.
If you have been approved for a leave of absence by Northeastern University and you are ready to return to your studies, it is important that you work with OGS to update your SEVIS record or to request that a new SEVIS record be created for you. All F-1 and J-1 students must follow both University processes and OGS processes in order to resume studies at Northeastern follow a leave of absence.

I am Returning from a Medical Leave of Absence (MLOA)

Students who wish to return from a MLOA must first apply and be approved for re-entry to Northeastern by University Health and Counseling Services (UHCS).

You may learn more about requesting re-entry from a MLOA on the UHCS Website.

Once you’ve received approval for re-entry from UHCS, you must work with OGS to request an updated Form I-20 or DS-2019.

If you were approved for a Medical Reduced Courseload (Medical RCL) and have an Active SEVIS record, please contact OGS to confirm that your immigration record does not need any adjustments.

To schedule an appointment with a DSO or ARO please call 617-373-2310 or visit our front desk. You may also email the DSO/ARO that you worked with when your Medical RCL was approved.

If your SEVIS record was terminated and you departed the U.S. for the duration of your MLOA, you will need to work with a DSO or ARO to determine your eligibility to request a new Initial I-20 or DS-2019 or to request the Reactivation of your SEVIS record. Please review the information found in the sections below.

I am returning from a Non-Medical Leave of Absence (NMLOA)

All students who wish to return from a NMLOA must contact OGS to determine your eligibility for Reactivation or for an Initial I-20. Not all students are eligible for Reactivation, so please reach out to OGS if you have any questions about eligibility!

Return from a LOA via Reactivation

Students who have been outside of the U.S. for less than 5 months may be eligible for Reactivation, a process during which the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) "reactivates" an eligible student's SEVIS record after a temporary absence.

Overview
F-1 Students who have been outside of the U.S. for less than 5-months and who were terminated for Authorized Early Withdrawal (AEW) may be eligible to request the reactivation of their SEVIS record. It is important to note that reactivation is adjudicated by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) and is never guaranteed.
Process

Approximately 60-days prior to the start date of the academic term in which you will resume classes, you may submit the OGS e-form Return from Non-Medical Leave of Absence less than 5 months

Students returning from a MLOA must wait until UHCS has approved their re-entry petition. This process only begins 30-days prior to the academic term in which you will resume classes

OGS will review your eligibility for Reactivation. If eligible, OGS will submit a letter to SEVP on your behalf to request the Reactivation of your SEVIS record
If your SEVIS record is successfully Reactivated, OGS will send you an updated I-20 that you may use to enter the U.S. no earlier than 30-days prior to the term in which you will resume classes.

If your Reactivation is denied by SEVP, you must request a new Initial I-20. Please follow the instructions for this process below.

If your visa has expired, apply for a new F-1 visa
You must enroll in a full-time course load with appropriate on-ground presence in the term for which you return, even if you return for the summer.*

*If you are returning from a leave of absence and only have 1 course remaining, you may be eligible for a final term reduced courseload. Please consult with an OGS advisor to ensure the maintenance of F-1 student status.

If you have any questions regarding your return from a Leave of Absence or Reactivation, please contact OGS to schedule an appointment by calling +1-617-373-2310. You may also email the advisor that you worked with on your Leave of Absence request.

Returning from a LOA with a New Initial I-20/DS-2019

Students who have been outside of the U.S. for more than 5-months must request a new Initial I-20/DS-2019

Overview
All students who have been outside of the U.S. for more than 5-months during a leave of absence must request a new Form I-20/DS-2019 from OGS. This I-20/DS-2019 will have a new SEVIS ID and will require you to pay the I-901 SEVIS fee, and also apply for a new F-1/J-1 visa.
Process

Complete the OGS e-form Request for SEVIS I-20/DS-2019 from a Non-Medical Leave of Absence of 5 Months or More

You will need to upload the following documents:

A copy of the biographical page of your passport
Academic Advisor/Authorized Secondary Approver Confirmation for Return from Leave of Absence of 5 Months or More Form
Updated financial document indicating source(s) and amount of support in U.S. dollars

OGS will review your submission and create a new Initial I-20/DS-2019 that will be sent to your Northeastern email
Pay the SEVIS fee online
If your visa has expired, apply for a new F-1/J-1 visa
Complete the OGS Online Immigration Clearance after arrival in the U.S.

Since you will be entering the U.S. with an Initial I-20 you must complete Immigration Clearance so OGS can register your arrival in SEVIS.

Important Reminders

Returning to the U.S. with an Initial I-20/DS-2019 may have an impact upon your eligibility for F-1/J-1 benefits such as Curricular Practical Training  (CPT), Optional Practical Training (OPT), and Academic Training. Federal regulations require that students complete at least one academic year (two semesters or three quarters) in order to be eligible for CPT or OPT. Please see the CPT and OPT pages of the OGS website for additional information on eligibility.

Dear Northeastern Students and Alumni,
Beginning on December 7, 2023, OGS deactivated its general office email addresses and implement a newly designed inquiry form in our self-service portal.
Effective immediately, students are encouraged to contact OGS through one of the below methods for
any inquiries or concerns:

1.  Submit a question online through our new inquiry form in the OGS self-service portal
2.  Call us over the phone (U.S.-based students) at +1-617-373-2310
3.  Visit us on the Boston Campus at 354 Richards Hall during regular office hours, or for walk-in
advising hours during the established hours
4.  For students currently studying at a Canadian campus, please email
[email protected] or check the links for drop-in advising hours or to make
an appointment:

Toronto: https://studentlifetoronto.sites.northeastern.edu/student-support-services/
Vancouver: Office of Global Services

As we outlined in an email announcement in late-September, OGS will no longer accept inbound emails to the general office email addresses mentioned below. Instead of emailing inquiries to
[email protected], or one of the other general office email addresses below, all questions should be submitted through the new inquiry form. This self-service portal aims to provide resources to students that will assist with answering frequently asked questions. If your question can’t be answered utilizing resources in the portal, you will be able to submit the inquiry form for review by the OGS team. This shift in communication method will allow students to receive answers to their questions as quickly as possible.
Effective immediately, the below email addresses will no longer be monitored:

[email protected], [email protected], [email protected],
[email protected], [email protected],
[email protected], [email protected],
[email protected], [email protected],
[email protected]

The following emails will remain the active for the following populations:

[email protected]: For all J-1 Scholars
[email protected]: For all current international students studying
in Toronto or Vancouver

Email, sent to OGS before today, will still receive a response and does not need to be resubmitted
through the inquiry form.
Tips for using the OGS self-service portal:

Always log in with your Northeastern credentials for a more personalized experience. This will
also lead to more accurate, timely responses.
Browse available knowledge articles in the portal for answers to frequently asked questions (and
check back often as new articles will continuously be added!)
Include as much information as possible when submitting an inquiry for the OGS team to best
advise you
Limit the number of inquiries you submit to OGS by including all your questions in the same
form
Check on your open inquiries (also known as cases) and provide any follow up information
through the “my cases” tab at the top of your portal rather than opening a new case

To access the OGS portal and to ask a question through the new inquiry form, please use this link:
https://service.northeastern.edu/ogs

As a reminder, this change will not impact other services provided by OGS, including the availability of
support via OGS’ main phone line for U.S.-based students or via visit to the Boston office in 354 Richards Hall.

We are looking forward to improving the services we offer to our international student population and
thank you in advance for your patience and flexibility throughout this transition.

Notes from the Office of Global Services

Requests for premium processing must be made directly to USCIS. OGS is unable to assist students with the application process.
Applying for premium processing with USCIS will not impact OGS processing time.
OGS recognizes that not all students will have the means to request premium processing from USCIS due to its high cost. We recognize the disparity that this may cause and encourage students to submit their applications as early as possible to ensure timely adjudication by USCIS.

SEVP Guidance for Academic Year 2021-2022

*Revised 05/17/2022  11:52 AM

Did DHS/SEVP (Department of Homeland Security/Student and Exchange Visitor Program) make any changes to their guidance for F-1 students?

DHS/SEVP updated their to extend certain flexibilities for remote learning for F-1 students studying at U.S. academic institutions due to the continuing public health concerns created by COVID-19 through the end of academic year 2021-22.

Who does this recent guidance apply to?

The March 2020 guidance applies to F-1 students who were actively enrolled at a U.S. school on March 9, 2020, and are otherwise complying with the terms of their F-1 status, whether from inside the U.S. or abroad.

What is academic year 2021-22?

The academic year comprises the following academic terms: Fall 2021, Winter 2022, and Spring 2022. See the university’s published academic year calendar here.

FAQs for F-1 International Students for Fall 2021 Academic Term

1

I am a new F-1 international student with an Initial I-20. What should I do if I foresee visa or travel delays and cannot arrive by the program start date indicated on my Form I-20?

Please ensure that you have communicated with your course faculty and academic advisor(s) regarding your late arrival date.
Please review the late arrival deadlines  and submit a request for a late arrival letter from the Office of Global Services.
Students will then receive an email with a link to complete a Travel Support Letter Request which explains to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the U.S. Port of Entry that your late arrival has been approved by your academic institution.

2

As a new international student with an Initial I-20, what should I do if I foresee not being able to arrive by the late arrival dates extended for Fall 2021 provided at the Office of Global Services website?

If you are not able to timely arrive on campus for Fall 2021 academic term, you will need approval from your college Academic Advisor to either participate remotely online or you must request a deferral of your admission from your college/program for the next available academic term.
If either remote participation or deferral of admission are approved by the college Academic Advisor, the student will need to also defer their Initial I-20 start date to the next available term with the Office of Global Services.
Click here to submit your request. Kindly ensure that you receive a new Initial I-20 with an updated program start date for your intended arrival to the U.S.
Important:
Please keep in mind that if you begin your studies outside of the U.S., you will earn academic credits, but you will not earn time in F-1 status which is required to earn eligibility for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) and Optional Practical Training (OPT).
Please remember to defer your I-20 start date if you will not be arriving by the date listed. If your SEVIS record is not updated, it will be automatically cancelled by the SEVIS system.  You should not attempt to enter the U.S. with a cancelled SEVIS record.

3

I am a continuing F-1 international student with an Active SEVIS record who returned home due to the pandemic. I am not able to return to the U.S. for the Fall 2021 academic term due to travel or visa restrictions. Can I study online remotely?

You must provide documentation confirming you are not able to return to the U.S. and request approval to study online remotely for the Fall 2021 academic term.
Important:
F-1 international students with an Active SEVIS record, who have been outside of the U.S. for more than 5 months, and are electing/choosing not to return for the Fall 2021 academic term, may result in the termination of their SEVIS record due to the length of time outside the U.S. Please also note the following:

Students who plan to return to the U.S. will need to apply for a new Initial I-20 with OGS.
Time accrued towards F-1 benefits will restart after entry to the U.S on the new Initial I-20.
CPT Authorization or OPT Eligibility does not begin until the student begins taking courses from within the U.S. with an Active SEVIS record and completes “one full academic year = two academic semesters or three academic quarters” of on ground enrollment at a U.S. campus.
If you have been engaging online from your home country for two academic terms, you will need at least “one full academic year = two academic semesters or three academic quarters” of on ground enrollment at a U.S. campus to earn eligibility for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) and Optional Practical Training (OPT).

4

I am an international student in the U.S. Can I apply to be a remote learner?

Northeastern University is offering in-person courses for the Fall 2021 academic term. If you are in the U.S., you must have on-ground presence during the academic term and maintain full-time status.  Due to immigration regulations, you cannot be approved to be a remote learner if you are in the U.S.
If you have an ADA requirement or medical condition, please contact the Disability Resource Center (DRC) to request an accommodation.

Curricular Practical Training (CPT)

I am currently on Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or I plan to start CPT in academic year 2021-22. Can I participate remotely in my practical training, and do I need to report remote practical training due to COVID-19?

Yes, you can participate remotely in practical training and should work with your employer to review available options where student engagement in practical training can be assessed using electronic means. Please report if you will be working remotely when you submit the CPT Authorization Request Form. You will be required to upload a Remote Work Letter, which you will need to request from your co-op advisor. This form is a required procedure for you and OGS to document your F-1 accommodations.
Important!  Make sure you are able to explain/document how you are providing services associated with the practical training while not at the location of the employer/organization.

What if I already have a pending or approved CPT Authorization for Summer-Fall 2021 and I will be working remotely? Do I need to submit the Remote Work Letter?

Please submit the CPT Update Form to submit the Remote Work Letter once you obtain the letter from your co-op advisor.

Do I need a wet signature on my CPT Authorization I-20?

Depending on your campus, you may require a wet signature on your CPT I-20 when applying for a Social Security Number (SSN)
Students located at the Boston campus do not require a wet signature and will be emailed their CPT I-20 as the Social Security Administration (SSA) offices in the Boston area are accepting electronically signed I-20s.
Students studying at all other campuses will require a wet signature on their CPT I-20 to apply for an SSN. The CPT Authorization Request e-form will ask if you already have a SSN. Please follow the instructions in the e-form to indicate if you will pick up your I-20 or if you would like the I-20 shipped to you if you do not have a SSN.
If you have a SSN, your I-20 will be sent electronically.

If I already started my program from my home country and studied remotely, when will I be eligible for CPT?

An F-1 student must have completed at least one academic year of full-time enrollment, which is defined as two full-time semesters or three full-time quarters on-ground or in person. When you arrive in the U.S. and OGS completes your SEVIS Registration, your SEVIS record changes from “Initial” To “Active.” Students with Active SEVIS records then begin accruing benefits of the F-1 visa status.
For example, if a student started their program from overseas in Spring 2021, they will not have completed the SEVIS Registration requirements and their enrollment in Spring 2021 will not count towards the one academic year of full-time enrollment.
More information about CPT eligibility can be found here.

Do students enrolled in global co-op require authorization to work remotely in the U.S.?

Yes, students who remain in the U.S. and plan to engage remotely for an international employer are required to apply for CPT Authorization. The CPT Authorization e-form can be found here. Students should not begin engaging remotely within the U.S. for any employer until they have obtained  authorization from OGS.  Be sure to understand and follow maintenance of status requirements.

I am a continuing student with an “Active” SEVIS record. I departed the U.S. due to the pandemic and I want to participate in a global coop. Do I need to apply for CPT?

No, if you are outside the U.S., you do not need to apply for CPT.

Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT)

I am currently on Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT). Are there any accommodations if I am not able to work and exceed my 90-day limit on unemployment?

The Department of Homeland Security’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) has recognized that the spread of COVID-19 may impact students engaging in OPT. Changes to workplace requirements may impact international students engaging in practical training. SEVP encourages such students to consult with their employer/practical training organization to seek alternative remote arrangements for engaging in employment/practical training where student engagement can be assessed using electronic means. Please fill out the accommodations for students on practical training e-form. This form is a required procedure for you and the university to document your F1 accommodations.
In addition, for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency, SEVP considers students who are working in their OPT opportunities fewer than 20 hours a week as engaged in OPT.
Important!  Make sure you are able to explain/document how you are providing services associated with the practical training while not at the location of the employer/organization.

Will there be an extension or suspension of the 90-day/150-day allowed period of unemployment for OPT and STEM OPT during the COVID-19 emergency?

The Department of Homeland Security is evaluating this issue but has not yet determined whether to implement a specific exemption for exceeding the regulatory limits for unemployment of 90 days for OPT and 150 days for STEM OPT.

Can I apply for OPT from overseas?
The Department of Homeland Security/U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is evaluating this and may issue additional guidance but currently this is not an option. The I-765 form still requires a mailing address in the U.S. USCIS will mail your EAD to this address, as well as any additional correspondence (such as a Request for Evidence). Please read the following 3 scenarios carefully:

If you have already applied for post-completion OPT, you are permitted to depart the U.S. while your application is pending, but there are some risks associated with this option.

Any OPT-related mail will be sent to the mailing address in the U.S. that you listed on the I-765 form. If no one will be available at that address to receive your mail, you will need to choose another mailing address in the U.S. and report it to USCIS following their instructions here: https://www.uscis.gov/addresschange. Mail may include your EAD (Employment Authorization Document) card or an RFE (Request for Evidence). RFEs are time-sensitive and if you do not respond in a timely manner your OPT application may be denied.
You may be scheduled to attend a biometrics appointment in the U.S. after filing your application for EAD.
If your OPT is approved while you are outside of the U.S., you will need to have your OPT EAD in hand before returning to the U.S.

If you are planning to apply for post-completion OPT but have not yet done so, apply while you are still in the U.S. Then refer to #1 above.
If this is your final academic term and you have already departed the U.S. without applying for OPT, you will have to return to the U.S. before your program end date. Given the current travel restrictions, please note this may be difficult, and you might forfeit your OPT benefit.

Social Security Numbers

BOSTON CAMPUS ONLY

The Social Security Administration (SSA) no longer requires appointments in order to visit an office, and has reverted to the pre-pandemic process of accepting applicants on a walk-in basis.  This means you should no longer mail or fax in documents.

Additionally, the SSA has launched a new online portal: OSSNAP – Online Social Security Number Application Portal allows you to enter your personal information prior to your visit to the SSA, so that when you go to the office, the SSA representative will only need to verify your information and check your documents.

OGS strongly encourages students to complete the online application prior to visiting the SSA office in person.  It will save time and speed up the process for you.

Please note that the SSA is only able to process your SSN application up to 30 days prior to your employment start date.

How do I apply for a Social Security Number (SSN)?

First, you will need to gain proper documentation from OGS, either an on-campus employment letter or Stipended Graduate Assistantship (SGA) letter (if you have an on-campus job or SGA) or an I-20 with CPT authorization on the second page (if you have a co-op/internship/etc.). You will need to submit the Letter Request or the CPT request to OGS and receive approval before visiting the SSA.
F-1 On-Campus Employment Authorization Letter Request
J-1 On-Campus Employment Authorization Letter Request
SGA Social Security Number Letter Request
CPT Authorization RequestPlease note that the SSA office will not be able to process your SSN application if you do not have the proper documentation from OGS.
Visit OSSNAP – Online Social Security Number Application Portal and start your SSN application by answering the questions online.
After completing the online application, note down the confirmation number. You must take the confirmation number and visit one of the SSA offices (ideally one closest to your residential address) within 45 days, but not more than 30 days before your employment start date.

Please keep in mind that masks are still required inside all SSA offices.

For all other campuses, please continue to contact your local SSA office to understand their process. We will continue to update our website as more information becomes available.

Overview and Definition

F-1 students enrolled in degree-seeking programs and J-1 degree-seeking and exchange students at Northeastern University are eligible to work on-campus while attending classes. The work does not need to be related to the student’s field of study. Students must maintain legal F-1 or J-1 status while engaging in on-campus employment.
On-campus employment includes:

Working for Northeastern University in the library, laboratories, residential buildings, administrative offices, or doing research on-campus
Employment with Northeastern based on a fellowship, assistantship, or grant (such as a teaching or research assistantship)
Employment with approved on-location commercial firms which provide services for students on campus, such as restaurants located in a University-owned building

If you have questions about if something counts as “on-campus” please review the list of eligible on-campus employers below or reach out to OGS directly.

Policies

Students may work up to 20 hours/week while school is in session and more than 20 hours per week during official school breaks (this does not include recesses or days with no class)
Continuing students may exceed 20 hours/week on campus work after the final exam period (which may be later than when final exams take place) is over.
Graduating students are allowed to work until the official last day of university finals. The dates of the finals period are posted in the Academic Calendar. (Check the calendar to confirm the dates for your school)
Students may be eligible to work on-campus while also engaging in Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or Pre-Completion Academic Training (AT) if allowed by their department.
Students holding a Stipended Graduate Assistantship (SGA) should review this page for eligibility/requirements and submit the appropriate request for that type of on-campus employment. Students engaging in an SGA may not work in additional on-campus jobs.
Remote on-campus employment:

F-1 students can participate in remote on-campus employment for a different Northeastern campus located in the U.S. that is not their home campus. F-1 students are not eligible to work remotely for a non-U.S. based Northeastern campus.

Example: An F-1 student at the Boston campus may be a Teaching Assistant for a course taking place at the Seattle campus. However, an F-1 student at the Silicon Valley campus cannot be a Teaching Assistant for a course taking place at the Toronto, Canada campus or other non-U.S. campus.

J-1 students may only participate in on-campus employment at the campus where they are attending classes and is listed as the site of activity on their DS-2019.

Application Process

F-1 Students:

If you already have a Social Security Number, you do not need to request an on-campus employment Social Security Number (SSN) Letter from the Office of Global Services (OGS). In this case, you can apply for on-campus work directly with the Office of Student Employment, Graduate Assistantships and Fellowship (SEGAF)
If you have been offered an on-campus job for the first time and do not have a Social Security Number (SSN), you will need to obtain an on-campus employment SSN letter from OGS. This letter can be presented to the Social Security Administration (SSA) in order to apply for a SSN. Please follow the steps below if you have a job offer and need to obtain a SSN.

J-1 Students:

J-1 students must receive employment authorization from the Office of Global Services (OGS) BEFORE they begin and for each position, regardless of whether they already have a social security number. Each on-campus employment position must be entered into your SEVIS record prior to you engaging in the opportunity.
Authorizations are granted for up to one year at a time or until the end of your J-1 program, whichever comes first.
If the J-1 student’s program sponsor is not Northeastern University, but an outside organization (such as Fulbright), the student will need to obtain employment authorization from the sponsoring organization.
J-1 students should submit a J-1 On-Campus Employment Authorization request to OGS.  See below for details. OGS will issue a letter which can be presented to the Social Security Administration in order to apply for a Social Security Number.

I just finished my last final exam; can I work more than 20 hours per week on-campus now?

Maybe. If you are a continuing student, you can only work more than 20 hours per week on campus after the final exam period (which may be later than when your final exams take place) is over. Check the University Calendar to confirm final exam periods. You can continue to work more than 20 hours per week until the start of the next semester (or for the duration of the summer, if eligible).

Can I work on-campus while I have Curricular Practical Training (CPT) approval for a co-op or internship?

Yes, you may work on-campus while you also have CPT if this is acceptable by your academic department. Please keep in mind that you can’t work on-campus at the same time that you hold a Stipended Graduate Assistantship (SGA).

I am graduating this semester. What is the last day that I can work?

You can work until the last day of the exam period; see the University Calendar to confirm this date.

Can I work on-campus if I am transferring in from another university or between degree levels?

Understanding Curricular Practical Training (CPT)

CPT is a form of authorization available for eligible F-1 students during their program of study for experiential learning opportunities that are necessary and integral, or required, as part of an academic program at Northeastern University.

CPT authorization must be obtained for every co-op, internship, practicum, clinical rotation, corporate residency, experiential PhD, or other approved experiential learning opportunity.
Authorization is required prior to the intended start date, whether or not the activity takes place on-campus or off-campus.
Students must maintain on-ground presence during every required term of study. This includes any required term when a student is authorized for full-time (or part-time) CPT.

Hybrid work models are acceptable work models for co-ops and other practical training experiences. Hybrid work is defined as any combination of in-person and remote work. Students need regular engagement with both the co-op practical training provider as well as the academic program to confirm successful progression of the practical training experience.

CPT can be either full-time (more than 20 hours per week) or part-time (20 hours or less per week).

Authorization for more than 364 days of full-time CPT will make you ineligible for Optional Practical Training (OPT)
Authorization for part-time CPT has no impact on your eligibility for OPT

CPT can be either paid or unpaid.

Whether paid or unpaid, CPT must be authorized by OGS in advance of commencing the activity. Retroactive authorization is not permitted by U.S. federal government regulations.

CPT is employer, location, full-time/part-time, and date specific.

The employer’s name, address and the precise start and end dates must be authorized by OGS in advance.

If you are a student considering volunteering or engaging in unpaid internships at Northeastern or a staff/faculty looking to hire a volunteer or unpaid intern, please review this guidance from Northeastern’s University Office of General Counsel.

Once authorized for CPT, F-1 students must comply with the authorization granted. Any extensions, cancellations, or changes to authorized CPT must be first approved by the academic advisor/co-op coordinator and OGS.
Non-curricular based on-campus activities (commonly referred to as “on-campus employment”) do not require CPT authorization. If you have any questions about how this applies to you, please contact OGS.

Watch the Video »

Eligibility requirements

In order to be eligible for CPT, students must meet all of the following requirements:

Comply with all college academic and enrollment eligibility requirements and policies for any experiential activities, including every co-op, internship, practicum, clinical rotation, corporate residency, experiential PhD, or other experiential learning opportunity, whether the activity takes place on-campus or off-campus.

All CPT requests must be reviewed and approved by an “Authorized Secondary Approver: CPT” from your college/academic department

Maintain enrollment in a co-op course or a program-required course that requires an experiential learning component in the syllabus. Enrollment must be maintained for the entire period of authorized CPT.

Per the Northeastern University catalog, students may not participate in co-op in their final term unless it is specified in the curriculum requirements of the program in the catalog.

Complete at least one academic year (two full semesters or three quarters) as a full-time, degree-seeking with an active SEVIS record.*
Maintain full-time enrollment and on ground presence during every required term of study.
Make normal progress towards degree completion.

CPT must not cause a delay in the completion of a student’s academic program.

Request CPT authorization that falls within current I-20 program dates

*Time spent in Prematriculation and Pathway programs (including N.U.in, Foundation Year, NU Immerse, Global Scholars, and Global Pathways) will not accrue time toward CPT eligibility. Students enrolled in such programs will only begin to accrue time toward CPT eligibility once they have fully matriculated into a degree-seeking program.
Limited exceptions may apply in the following circumstances:

For students in graduate-level programs that require immediate participation in experiential learning for program completion.
For students who completed one academic year in another visa status or institution changed to F-1 status within the U.S. or by travel and re-entry, who otherwise qualify. *Change of Status and Transfer Students please read that section further down on this page.

Please note: It is an F-1 student’s responsibility to maintain their F-1 status. In order to apply for CPT at Northeastern a student must be both academically eligible as well as compliant with U.S. federal government regulations as outlined above.

Application Process

To participate in an experiential learning opportunity in the U.S., F-1 students must obtain CPT authorization from OGS. All CPT requests must first be academically reviewed, approved, and determined to be integral or required for degree completion, by the appropriate advisor, co-op coordinator, or SEVIS contact.

Step 1: Student completes the CPT Authorization Request e-form

The student must fill out the CPT Authorization Request e-form. The documents the student will need include:

Electronic I-94 (“Class of Admission” must be F-1 and “Admit Until Date” must indicate “D/S”)
Passport identity page that is valid at least until the start date of the CPT authorization

When the student has submitted the e-form it will be routed to the secondary approver as indicated in the e-form.

Step 2: Secondary approver reviews student's CPT e-form submission

The Authorized Secondary Approver (CPT) who receives the request will review the information the student has entered and determine if they approve it academically as either integral or required for program completion. If approved, the Authorized Secondary Approver will submit the request to OGS.
If the Authorized Secondary Approver does not approve of the request, they will email the student directly regarding their decision.

Step 3: OGS reviews completed CPT e-form submission

Upon receipt of the completed e-form from the Secondary Approver, OGS will review the CPT request within 15 business days*. OGS will examine the student’s documents to determine if they meet all F-1 eligibility requirements for CPT. OGS may place the request on hold and email the student/advisor for more information or approve/deny the CPT request.
*Processing times may be variable depending on the time of year.

Step 4: Student receives updated I-20 with CPT recommendation

If your CPT request is approved, a Designated School Official (DSO) from OGS will send the I-20 electronically to your Northeastern University email. You are advised to:

Review your I-20 to ensure all information is accurate and complete
Print and sign your I-20
Only work within the listed start and end dates on your I-20

Updating or changing your CPT authorization

While on CPT, any updates, extensions, changes, or cancellations to your employment must be reported to and approved both by your academic/co-op advisor and by a Designated School Official (DSO) in OGS. These changes include:

Employer
Location
Date
Number of hours worked per week (full-time/part-time)
Cancellations
Other corrections

Once authorized for CPT, F-1 students must comply with the authorization granted.

How CPT affects OPT eligibility

If an F-1 student exceeds 364 days of full-time CPT (more than 20 hours per week at a degree level—bachelor’s, master’s or doctorate), they will lose their eligibility to apply for OPT at that degree level.

When counting CPT days, every day between the start and end date of CPT counts (including the start and end dates). The days that are counted are the days that the student had authorization, not the days the student actually worked. This means even if it was a weekend, holiday, vacation etc., it still counts if the student had CPT authorization.

It is the responsibility of the student to track of how many full-time CPT days have been used per degree level. Students can use previously issued I-20s to document this. Students may also request a summary of their CPT authorization history at Northeastern from OGS via this e-form.

Part-time CPT (20 hours per week or less) does not accrue time towards the 364-day calculation.
Students who require more than 364 days of full-time CPT at a degree level to complete their degree program are not in violation of their F-1 status, however they will lose OPT eligibility for the same degree level.

OGS does not keep track and communicate if students will be exceeding the 364-day mark when students are requesting CPT authorization. Students must keep this in mind when requesting CPT authorization.
Please Note: CPT is a benefit of F-1 status, not a guarantee. While students may be able to work up to 364 days while maintaining OPT eligibility, CPT authorization is directly tied to a student’s academic curriculum. Therefore, the amount of CPT for which students are eligible and may be authorized is entirely based on their program of study, as well as F-1 federal regulations. Simply because an F-1 student has not engaged in 364 days of full-time CPT does not necessarily mean the student is eligible for additional CPT or an extension of a current CPT authorization.

Video: How CPT affects OPT Eligibility

Change of Status and Transfer Students

Change of status
Full-time students who are applying to change their immigration status to F-1 within the U.S. (application through USICS) or by traveling (via consular processing) may be eligible to use time from a previous immigration status towards accruing benefits, such as Curricular Practical Training (CPT), as long as the student has maintained full-time F-1 enrollment requirements.
Please contact OGS to make an appointment with an advisor to discuss CPT eligibility and bring all applicable documentation with you (for example a copy of your I-797 approval notice if you changed status within the U.S.).
Transfer students
International students with Active F-1 records, who transfer their SEVIS record to Northeastern University, and maintained status, may be able to use accrued time towards the one academic year requirement from the previous institution.
Please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 to make an appointment with a Designated School Official (DSO) to discuss CPT eligibility and have all applicable documentation available (for example a copy of your official transcript and previous I-20).
Please note: if you transfer to Northeastern on an initial I-20, your one academic year accrual resets as an initial student.

Frequently Asked Questions

×

Can I do Curricular Practical Training in my final semester?

The Office of Global Services will only authorize CPT in the final semester if the student’s degree program meets the following requirement:

Student is required to enroll in a course that requires CPT in order to complete degree requirements

You must also make sure to maintain your on-ground enrollment requirement during your final term. As a reminder, you must also have approval from your co-op coordinator or advisor to engage in CPT in your final semester in addition to meeting the above the Office of Global Services requirement.

Can I do remote work from home for Curricular Practical Training?

F-1 students must maintain their non-immigrant status with on-ground presence while authorized for CPT by either:

Engaging on-site at the designated employer’s location. This can be 100% in-person or hybrid.
Engaging 100% remotely with the designated employer with simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course. For questions about required on-ground course registration, students must discuss and receive approval from their assigned co-op coordinator/academic advisor.

Can I get Curricular Practical Training for my independent study course?

Unfortunately, independent study courses do not qualify for CPT authorization.

Do I need authorization for an internship, co-op etc. that is unpaid?

Yes! Any work for a course that takes place off-campus must have prior authorization, even if this work is unpaid.

Is there a limit to the number of hours per week I can work while on Curricular Practical Training?

In order to know the answer to this, you will need to understand what kind of CPT authorization you have. You can find this information on the second page of your I-20. If your I-20 states you have part-time CPT, then this means you can never exceed 20 hours per week. If your I-20 states you have full-time CPT, then this means there is no limit to the number of hours per week you can work. However, you must always check with your advisor or co-op coordinator to see if they have a limit to the number of hours per week you can work.

Do I need authorization for training dates?

Yes, all training dates require authorization. Remember, just because an opportunity is unpaid does not mean it does not require authorization.

How will I know if I have Curricular Practical Training authorization?

You will know if you have CPT authorization by checking the second page of your most recent I-20. On the second page of your I-20, you will see all the details of your employment authorization.

Can I do a co-op/Internship and take classes at the same time?

CPT means you must always be enrolled in a course that requires you to be engaging off-campus. So, whenever you have CPT authorization, by default you must be enrolled in courses. If you would like to enroll in additional or supplemental courses (to the one that is already requiring you to engage off-campus), you must check with your co-op department or advisor to see if there are academic or university restrictions that would prevent you from doing so.

Can I work on-campus while I have Curricular Practical Training?

Yes, students are allowed to work on-campus while they also have CPT. However, students are not allowed to work on an SGA (Stipended Graduate Assistantship) and have CPT at the same time.
Please keep in mind that some coop departments may not allow you to work on-campus and be on coop at the same time or may have restrictions on how much on-campus employment is allowed while on coop. If this is the case, you will need to follow your coop department’s rules.

My employer offered to extend my co-op/internship on a part-time basis. Can I do this?

As a general rule, coop is typically not allowed to be part-time. You will need to consult with your coop coordinator to determine if you are eligible to continue part-time.
Remember, all CPT (full-time and part-time) must meet all eligibility requirements. If you wish to extend your CPT authorization on a part-time basis, this would need to meet all CPT eligibility requirements listed under our Curricular Practical Training Basics section.

Does part-time Curricular Practical Training count towards the 364 day mark that affects my Optional Practical eligibility?

No, part-time CPT authorization does not count towards the 364 day mark that affects Optional Practical Training eligibility.

How can I find out how much Curricular Practical Training time I've used?

As a reminder, it is the student’s responsibility to keep track of how much CPT time they’ve used. Students can see how much CPT time they’ve used by looking at past I-20s. Students can also request a screenshot of their current SEVIS record from the Office of Global Services using our Curricular Practical Training Authorization History Request on our Forms and Guides page. This will show students all periods of CPT they have used at their current degree level.
NOTE: The Office of Global Services will not provide students with a count of how much CPT time has been used. The Office of Global Services will only provide a listing of any periods of authorization that have been given. Also, the Office of Global Services is not able to provide information on CPT used at other institutions. Students should contact previous institutions for any CPT time used there.

Can my CPT employer be through Northeastern University?

If you are a student considering volunteering or engaging in a paid/unpaid internships at Northeastern or a staff/faculty looking to hire a volunteer or intern, please review this guidance from Northeastern University Office of General Counsel.

Can I end my CPT earlier than the original end date?

Students must consult with their co-op and/or academic advisor if there will be any changes to their approved Co-op/CPT employment in order to ensure that all academic requirements will be met (this link is specific to Co-op requirements). Then, students must follow up with OGS by completing the CPT Update E-form to report changes to OGS in order to receive an updated I-20.
Overview

Optional Practical Training (OPT) is an employment authorization benefit for F-1 students for the purpose of gaining practical experience directly related to their major field of study. It is the responsibility of the student to determine if the accepted employment is related to his/her program of study. Students may engage in Pre-Completion OPT (or Pre-OPT) while actively enrolled in an academic program. To request Pre-OPT work authorization, students must:

Request a Pre-OPT Recommendation in their SEVIS record from the Office of Global Services
Submit an application to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for review and adjudication

Students are eligible for a total of 12-months of Optional Practical Training (OPT) at each degree level. This means that any time for which a student receives Pre-OPT authorization will be subtracted from the time available for Post-Completion OPT.
Note: Pre-OPT work authorization is only available to students when they are actively enrolled at Northeastern. In order to request work authorization post-graduation, students must submit an application for Post-Completion OPT.

Eligibility

A Bachelor’s or Master’s degree student may be eligible to apply for Pre-OPT prior to completion of studies both during the academic year and during the annual vacation period.
PhD students may be eligible to apply for Pre-OPT any time during the program of study if all course work other than the thesis/dissertation has been completed.
To apply for Pre-OPT, all of the following criteria must be met:

Student has maintained valid F-1 student status
Student has studied full-time in the U.S. for at least 1 academic year

Time spent in language training and non-degree programs does not count toward the one academic year requirement

Student has not exceeded 364 days of full-time Curricular Practical Training (CPT) at the current degree level
Student has not previously engaged in 12 months of full-time Pre- or Post-OPT at the current degree level
Student has registered for a full-time courseload with appropriate on-ground presence during the entire period of requested Pre-OPT

This does not apply if the requested Pre-OPT will take place during the annual vacation period

Full-time vs. Part-time Pre-OPT

A student may be eligible to apply for part-time (less than 20 hours per week) or full-time (more than 20 hours per week) Pre-OPT. Please see below for eligibility requirements for both options:
Part-Time Pre-OPT (20 or less hours/week):

During an academic term
During annual vacation and other official school breaks

Full-Time Pre-OPT (more than 20 hours/week):

During annual vacation and other official school breaks
For PhD students who have completed all coursework except thesis/dissertation
NOTE: full-time pre-OPT is NOT allowed during required academic terms except for certain PhD students as mentioned in the bullet above

Special Considerations for PhD students

If a PhD student has completed all coursework but is in the final stages of thesis/dissertation, immigration regulations allow the student to apply for either Pre-Completion OPT or Post-Completion OPT while completing the thesis/dissertation.
In this case, the PhD student and his/her college need to determine the program completion date, which will be reflected on the I-20.
If you choose to apply for Post-Completion OPT while completing your thesis/dissertation:

You must fulfill the reporting requirements of Post-OPT
The days you do not have a job count towards your 90 days of unemployment time
You cannot request a program extension even if your thesis/dissertation is not completed after Post-OPT is expired

Note: If you are a student with Stipended Graduate Assistantship (SGA), you must discuss with your department to determine when your SGA will end. The SGA cannot extend beyond the end date as listed on your I-20.

Mailing Your Application to USCIS (If not filing Online)

USCIS recommends filing online. However, if you choose to file your application with USCIS via a mail service, please review these instructions.

Guidance for Mailing a Pre-OPT Application to USCIS

We strongly recommend that you make copies of your complete application for your records before mailing your application to USCIS.
Once you have assembled your Pre-OPT I-20 and all other required documents into a packet, you must send it to the USCIS address below. However, it is always best practice to confirm the most up to date USCIS Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765 directly on the USCIS website. It is recommended you mail your OPT packet through certified mail which includes a tracking number and guaranteed delivery date.
Effective 01/08/2021, you will mail your application to the USCIS Chicago lockbox:
For U.S. Postal Service deliveries:
Attn: I-765 C03
P.O. Box 805373
Chicago, IL 60680-5374
For courier service deliveries (non-U.S. Postal Service: FedEx, UPS, and DHL):
USCIS
Attn: I-765 C03 (Box 805373)
131 South Dearborn – 3rd Floor
Chicago, IL 60603-5517
eShipGlobal Mailing Option
eShipGlobal offers a shipping service for international students sending their OPT applications to USCIS. Students can choose their carrier (UPS, FedEx, or USPS) and type of delivery (next day, 2-day, etc.) and ship at discounted rates. This service is not a Northeastern University service. All inquiries should be directed to eShipGlobal directly.
USCIS Processing Times

USCIS advertises normal processing time for OPT requests as being around 100 days.
You can check current processing times on USCIS’s website

After the documentation leaves the respective Lockbox, it is forwarded to the USCIS Service Center. About fifteen days after USCIS receives your application for Pre-OPT, you should receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) from USCIS.

What Happens After I Submit my Application to USCIS?

You should receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) from USCIS. You can look up your case status online using the case number.

If you file online you will receive this receipt notice electronically within a day or two. If you file by mail you should receive this notice within 2-weeks.
If you submitted the G1145 form with your application, you will be informed electronically by email and/or text
If you paid for your Pre-OPT fee by personal check, the back of the cashed check will have the number. You may obtain a copy of this check from your bank.
You may contact the USCIS call center at 800-375-5283.

Once USCIS adjudicates your application and your Pre-OPT is approved, expect to first receive an approval notice and then an EAD.
You must not work until you receive your EAD card and you may only work within the dates specified on the EAD card.

The EAD card, not your approval notice, is your work authorization documentation.

Note: Your application will remain in “pending” status until a decision has been made on your application (this may be a few months). Adjudication of your application is completed by USCIS. Therefore, USCIS will inform you directly of the official receipt, request for additional information, and the decision on your application. Please be aware that this is a normal processing timeframe, and regrettably, OGS is unable to assist in expediting any requests.
OGS is here to guide you if you receive any communication from USCIS that requires response (request for additional information, denial, etc.).

Unemployment During Pre-OPT

There are no restrictions on unemployment during Pre-OPT.
Students are not required to have a job offer to apply for Pre-Completion OPT; however, it is advantageous to have prospective employment opportunities since any time authorized for Pre-OPT is subtracted from the time available for Post-OPT, whether the student obtains employment or not.

Important Reminders

USCIS must receive the Pre-OPT application within 30 days of the issued OPT recommendation by OGS; if the application is not received by USCIS within 30 days after the issuance of the OPT I-20, the application will be denied (this is the most common reason for the denial of Pre-OPT)
If your entire application is returned to you, consult with an OGS Advisor before resubmitting the application; your application may not be considered “received” and you may need a new I-20 with OPT recommendation
Do not submit a Pre-OPT application to USCIS prior to obtaining an I-20 with the OPT recommendation
Make sure that the address on your OPT application is valid for receiving mail at all times during OPT processing
If you have a pending Pre-OPT application and are simultaneously applying for Post-OPT, OGS will not issue a Post-Completion OPT Recommendation I-20 until:

Your Pre-Completion OPT application has been approved by USCIS and you have received your EAD, or
OGS receives confirmation that your application has been withdrawn by USCIS (or was never submitted to USCIS).

Travel While on Pre-OPT

During Pre-OPT, travel restrictions remain the same as they are during normal F-1 study. You should carry the following documents when re-entering the U.S.:

A passport which should be valid for at least six months from the date you return to the U.S.
Unexpired F-1 visa
I-20 with a valid travel signature (travel signatures are valid for 1 year)

You can review more information about traveling internationally here.

F-1 Students Can Now File Form I-765 Online
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced on 4/12/2021 that F-1 students seeking Optional Practical Training (OPT) and 24 month STEM Extension of OPT (STEM) can now file online.  Please click here for the entire announcement.  Please remember that the first step in your application continues to be requesting your OPT or STEM recommendation I-20 form from OGS.  Review the  Applying for OPT, and  Applying for STEM Extension for more details.

Frequently Asked Questions

×

My application was rejected and returned to me because of a missing signature on I-765 or an issue with my check/money order. What do I do?

Do NOT mail the application yet. Contact OGS and make an appointment with an OGS advisor. You will most likely need a new Pre-Completion OPT recommendation and will need to reapply to the USCIS. You cannot resubmit your application if there is any chance your I-20 with Pre-Completion OPT recommendation will be more than 30 days old when it is received by the USCIS; this would result in a denial. If your packet has been returned to you, it is not considered received.

I received a Request for Evidence from the USCIS. What should I do?

You are required to respond to the Request for Evidence by the deadline specified on the letter. If you can prepare the document(s) they ask for, you may respond on your own. If you have any questions, you may make an appointment with an OGS advisor.

How do I change my address while my Pre-Completion OPT application is pending?

While your application is still pending with the USCIS, follow the instructions below to update your mailing address:
https://egov.uscis.gov/coa/displayCOAForm.do
If you are moving and not just updating the address to which your EAD card should be mailed, then you must also update your address on your myNortheastern account.

How do I withdraw my Pre-OPT application?

If your application is still pending with the USCIS, and you decide not to pursue Pre-Completion OPT, you may withdraw your application. In this case, you will need to mail a letter to request withdrawal of your application to the USCIS address that is listed on your receipt notice, and a copy of your receipt notice.
The letter should include the following elements:

Note “Re: I-765 Withdrawal” on the letter
Include biographical information to identify the student, including name, date of birth, and SEVIS Identification number
Reference the receipt number for the I-765 application (from the Form I-797 receipt notice); a copy of the receipt notice can also be helpful
Specific request that the Form I-765 application for Pre-Completion OPT be withdrawn
Student’s signature

Once your application is withdrawn, you should receive the withdrawal acknowledgement letter from USCIS. If you do not receive anything within 1 month, please contact OGS.

What happens if my EAD card has incorrect information on it?

If your EAD card was processed by the Potomac Service Center:
If your Form I-765 was approved by the Potomac Service Center and your EAD contains incorrect information due to the USCIS error, you must return the original card along with a detailed explanation of the error and supporting documentation to the Potomac Service Center at:
Potomac Service Center
USCIS
2200 Potomac Center Drive, Stop 2425
Arlington, VA 20598-2425
In these cases, you do not need to submit a new Form I-765 and filing fee. The Potomac Service Center will issue a corrected EAD within 30 days of receiving your EAD that contains incorrect information due to the USCIS error.
If you return your Potomac Service Center-approved EAD card and the Potomac Service Center determines that your card contains incorrect information that is not due to the USCIS error, the Potomac Service Center will return the EAD card to you. In this case, you will have to follow the process detailed in the Replacement EAD section of the Employment Authorization Document page on order to have your card corrected.
If you do not find the information you need through our online services and need further assistance, you may contact our National Customer Service Center at 1-800-375-5283 or 1-800-767-1833 Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD).
If your EAD card was processed by a Service Center other than Potomac, call the USCIS customer service at 1-800-375-5283 or 1-800-767-1833 and ask for instructions.
https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/contact-us/national-customer-service-center

I did not get my EAD card in the mail after receiving the approval notice. What do I do?

Find your tracking number of your mail from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services case status, contact the U.S. Postal Service to see if they can locate your EAD card if it already says “delivered” status.
If your card is not received within 2-3 weeks of receiving your approval notice or seeing that your case status shows your card was “delivered,” then you can make an e-request through the USCIS. Please note: This e-request may result in a response from the USCIS or it may result in the production of an EAD card; a new card is estimated to take approximately 120 days.
For questions about this e-request through the USCIS, please contact the USCIS Customer Service at:
1-800-375-5283 or 1-800-767-1833
If it is determined that your EAD is lost in the mail and you do not want to wait for a response from the USCIS, you will have to apply for a replacement of EAD by submitting the following documents to the lockbox, as you did for your initial application. Processing times will be the same as processing times for the initial OPT approval.

Letter explaining what happened to previously issued card (include police report if applicable)
I-765 (check the box that indicates that you are applying for a “Replacement” card)
G-1145
$410 check, money order or bank check made payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Copies of previous I-20s
Copy of F-1 visa
Copy of passport
Passport photos
Approval Notice of Optional Practical Training/Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)

I do not have a Social Security Number. When can I apply for one?

You may apply for a Social Security Number when you apply for your Pre-Completion OPT. When filling out the I-765, Field 14 Do you want the SSA to issue you a Social Security card? – Check “Yes” and you will receive a SSN with your Pre-Completion OPT.

How many days of unemployment can I have during Pre-Completion OPT?

There are no restrictions of unemployment during Pre-Completion OPT. Students are not required to have a job offer to apply for Pre-Completion OPT; however, it is usually advantageous to at least have prospective employment opportunities since any time authorized for Pre-Completion OPT is subtracted from the time available for Post-Completion OPT, whether the student obtains employment or not.

I applied for Pre-Completion OPT. My application is still pending, but now I want to apply for Post-Completion OPT; what do I do?

If you have a pending Pre-OPT application and you would like to apply for Post-OPT, then you will need to deduct the entire requested Pre-Completion OPT period from your 12 months of Post-Completion OPT. If your Pre-Completion OPT has been approved, the entire approved period will be deducted from your 12 months of Post-Completion OPT.
Part-time Pre-Completion OPT is deducted at half the rate from your Post-Completion OPT. For example, if you are approved for 4 months of part-time Pre-Completion OPT, then 2 months will be deducted from your 12 months of Post-Completion OPT.

I am doing Pre-OPT and want to do Post-Completion OPT right after. Do I have to apply twice or can I apply for both at the same time?

Pre-Completion OPT and Post-Completion OPT applications have to be done separately. If you are planning to do both Pre-Completion OPT and Post-Completion OPT, you will have to apply to the USCIS twice (and pay an application fee each time).

It is my last semester and I only have one class to take – can I work full-time on Pre-Completion OPT?

During your last semester, even if you are under-enrolled, you are still taking required course(s), so you can only engage in part-time Pre-Completion OPT (20 hours per week or less).

Can I work on-campus while I am on Pre-Completion OPT?

Students on Pre-Completion OPT can work on-campus in addition to working on Pre-Completion OPT.
Students cannot engage in a Stipended Graduate Assistantship position while on Pre-Completion OPT.
Academic Training Explained

Academic Training (AT) is employment authorization granted to eligible J-1 Students. It is designed to complement their programs of study in the United States.

AT is authorized by the program sponsor
Students may engage in AT during their academic program and/or after the completion of their studies
AT can be paid or unpaid, but must be authorized regardless of compensation
The work must be directly related to the student’s field of study
The work must be commensurate with their level of education
The work must be in a fully in-person or hybrid position (with no more than 40% remote)
The total amount of AT cannot exceed the total length of the academic program
AT authorization is location and date specific. The employer’s name and address and the employment dates must be authorized in advance by an Alternate Responsible Officer (ARO) in the Office of Global Services (OGS).

Pre-Completion vs. Post-Completion Academic Training

Pre-completion AT takes place before the J-1 Student completes all of their degree requirements. Post-Completion AT takes place after the J-1 student has completed all degree requirements.

Eligibility Requirements

A J-1 Student is eligible for Academic Training if they meet the following requirements:

Student has maintained valid J-1 status throughout their program
Student is in good academic standing or has successfully completed program of study
Student is proposing a training experience that is directly related to their field of study and has been approved by the academic advisor or Co-op coordinator
Student will not engage in a 100% remote academic training opportunity. Students may work remotely no more than 40% of the time (e.g., two days out of five in a standard work week) when their employers have instituted partial remote policies. Please see the June 2023 Department of State guidance directive for more information.
Student is maintaining health insurance coverage for themselves and any J-2 dependents

PLEASE NOTE: As Global Experience Office (GEO) incoming exchange programs at Northeastern do not currently include an internship experience, non-degree exchange students are not eligible to apply for Academic Training.

Time Limitations

J-1 Undergraduate and Master’s Degree students are eligible for up to 18 months of AT; this includes both pre- and post-completion AT

NOTE: through December 31, 2024, the Department of State is allowing extension up to 36 months (or length of degree program, whichever is shorter) for undergraduate and master’s degree level students in eligible STEM fields. Please contact OGS for more information.

J-1 Doctoral Degree students are eligible for up to 36 months of AT; this includes both pre- and post-completion AT
The total AT period may not exceed the amount of time spent in a full course of study

Example: A Master’s student who completed their program in 12 months is only eligible for 12 months of AT

Post-AT time begins the day after the program end date listed on your DS-2019, whether you are working or not.

Example: If your graduation date is 5/8/2019, you must start counting your post-AT time on 5/9/2019, even if you do not start working on that date

It is your responsibility to track your AT usage
Post-AT authorization must be processed before the graduation date on your DS-2019
Post-AT must begin within 30 days completion of your studies.

Please note: Both full and part-time AT deduct at a full-time rate. This means that, even if AT authorization is given for work done on a part-time basis, each day of part-time training deducts a full day from the total amount of time a student is eligible for AT.

Requesting Authorization

To participate in an off-campus experiential learning opportunity in the U.S., J-1 Students must obtain AT authorization from OGS. All students must comply with their college's requirements and policies concerning the timing of eligibility for Co-op or other experiential learning opportunity. Please note that individual academic departments or colleges may have additional requirements and regulations for eligibility. OGS will not review any requests for AT that have not already been reviewed by the appropriate advisor.

1

Meet with your academic or Co-op advisor to discuss your experiential learning opportunity.

OGS will not review any requests that have not been approved by your academic or Co-op advisor.

2

Complete the Academic Training Authorization Request with your academic or Co-op advisor.

The Academic Training Authorization Request Form can be found on the Office of Global Services website.

3

Upload the appropriate completed e-form with your advisor signature at the link provided on the first page of instructions.

Valid passport
I-94 showing J-1 class of admission and an admit until date of D/S
Original offer letter that shows the following:

company letterhead
employment start and end dates
hours worked per week
compensation

For post-completion AT only: if the salary is less than $2,334 per month, the student must submit additional financial documentation to meet the minimum funding requirements

4

Receive your DS-2019 with AT Authorization from an ARO in the Office of Global Services

OGS will review the student’s request to determine whether or not the student is eligible to participate in AT. If denied, the student will need to resubmit the e-form after making appropriate adjustments to their application. Authorized students will receive an email to their Northeastern University email address with their digitally-signed DS-2019 and AT authorization letter for Social Security Number eligibility attached.
PLEASE NOTE: approval from your academic or co-op advisor for an off-campus internship/co-op does NOT mean you are automatically authorized to work off-campus. You should not engage in any off-campus employment until you receive an authorization from OGS.

Important post-completion Academic Training reminders

Post-completion AT applications must be submitted at least 15 business days your completion of studies (DS-2019 program end date). After this date, the SEVIS record will become inactive and OGS will be unable to authorize AT.
Post-completion AT employment must begin within 30 days of your completion of studies (DS-2019 program end date).

Example: If a student’s graduation date is 5/8/2019, work on post-completion AT would need to start by 6/7/2019.

Reviewing your updated DS-2019

When receiving your electronic DS-2019 OGS, it is very important that you read your DS-2019 carefully to make sure you understand the limitations of your authorization. This will help prevent you from violating your status.
Please pay specific attention to the following areas:

Box 3 Form Covers Period – here you can see your new end date (if on post-completion AT)
Box 5 Academic Training – here you can see your employer information as well as the dates you are authorized to work

If there are any issues or concerns, please notify an Alternate Responsible Officer (ARO) in OGS.

Maintaining status while on Academic Training

While on AT, it is important you update OGS of any changes to your training. AT Authorization is employer, location, and date specific. Depending on the change, OGS may request additional documentation. It is important you do not engage in any changes until you have received your updated DS-2019 from OGS.
NOTE: OGS will not update your AT unless you have approval from the original advisor who signed off on your Academic Training Authorization Request.
100% remote work during academic training is not permitted per Department of State guidance. Students may work remotely no more than 40% of the time (e.g., two days out of five in a standard work week) when their employers have instituted partial remote policies.
IMPORTANT REMINDER REGARDING AT EXTENSIONS: If you are seeking an extension of your AT authorization, you may not request an extension via the update e-form. If you are extending your AT, you must submit the Academic Training Authorization Request.
For all other changes to AT, please submit the AT Updates Request.

Frequently Asked Questions »

Frequently Asked Questions

×

When do I need authorization?

This question is based off of what the U.S. government considers to be employment. Employment is considered work for compensation. Compensation can be monetary, but it can also be food, travel, lodging, or even beneficial experience. If you are benefiting from your participation in any way, you require authorization.
IMPORTANT: Just because an opportunity is unpaid does not mean it does not require authorization.

Do I need a valid visa to apply for Academic Training?

No. Visas are for entry purposes only. OGS does not require your visa to authorize AT.

How do I calculate how much money I will need for Post-Academic Training time?

Students are required to show a minimum of $2,334 per month when requesting or extending AT. In cases which require students to prorate how much money they need to show, the following breakdown may be helpful:

Per month – $2,334
Per week – $584
Per day – $84

What kind of financial documents can I submit if I'm applying for Post-Academic Training?

Financial documentation must meet the following criteria:

Be in English or a verified English translation
Show name of account holder. If the account holder is not the student, the account holder must submit a signed statement taking financial responsibility for the student.
Be issued within the past nine months
Be liquid (see below for examples of acceptable vs. unacceptable funds)

Acceptable forms of liquid funding:

Checking or savings account
Money market account
Certificates/term/fixed deposits (with maturity dates no later than the program start date)
Educational loans (a loan application is not sufficient)
Benevolent account
Current account
Post office account
Job offer letter

Investment portfolios (stocks, bonds, mutual funds)
Retirement plans
Public Provident funds
Available lines of credit
Wire transfers
Deeds to real estate
Leases with rental income
Salary agreements or pay stubs
Material items (livestock, land, jewelry, fur)
Income tax forms
Severe Economic Hardship Employment for F-1 Students

An F-1 student may apply for off-campus employment if s/he is able to provide evidence of severe, economic need caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond the student’s control. When an F-1 student first enters a program of study, s/he must provide evidence of financial support in order to obtain an initial Form I-20. However, if there are extenuating circumstances that arise later and are out of the control of the student, s/he may be eligible to apply to work off-campus for a period of one year.
Eligibility
In order to be eligible to apply for employment based on Severe Unforeseen Economic Hardship, a student must:

Be in valid F-1 student status
Have completed 1 full academic year (2 semesters or 3 terms)
Demonstrate that loss of funding is unforeseen beyond the student’s control and that off-campus work is necessary for the student to continue the academic program

Circumstances that may warrant a reason to apply for Severe Economic Hardship may include “loss of financial aid or on-campus employment without fault on the part of the student, substantial fluctuations in the value of currency or exchange rate, inordinate increases in tuition and/or living costs, unexpected changes in the financial condition of the student’s source of support, medical bills, or other substantial and unexpected expenses.” 8 CFR 214.2(f)(9)(ii)
If you would like to apply to USCIS for Economic Hardship, please read this Information Handout for information on the process. Please complete Step 1 before you submit the E-Form.
For more information about economic hardship, please contact OGS to schedule an appointment with a Designated School Official (DSO) by calling +1-617-373-2310 or visiting the front desk at 354 Richards Hall in Boston.

Off-Campus Employment Based on Economic Hardship for J-1 Students

A J-1 student may be eligible for authorization to work off-campus if “serious, urgent, and unforeseen economic circumstances” have arisen since they acquired J-1 exchange visitor status. Authorization for Severe Economic Hardship employment must be granted by an Alternate Responsible Officer (ARO) in the Office of Global Services (OGS) before any employment begins.
Eligibility
J-1 students may be eligible to apply for employment based on severe economic hardship if they are in valid J-1 status and off-campus employment is necessary due to a circumstance in which the economic need is serious, urgent, and unforeseen.
Application
For more information about economic hardship, please contact OGS to schedule an appointment with a Alternate Responsible Officer (ARO) by calling +1-617-373-2310 or visiting the front desk at 354 Richards Hall in Boston.

Special Student Relief (SSR)

Special Student Relief (SSR) may be available to certain F-1 students experiencing severe economic hardship due to emergent conditions (i.e. natural disasters, wars and military conflicts, national or international financial crises, or other circumstances in their country of citizenship (or in certain cases, residence)). If granted, SSR suspends certain types of restrictions on F-1 off-campus employment eligibility and may allow authorized students to reduce their course load below full-time.

Overview of SSR
Countries covered by SSR
February 22, 2023 USCIS Policy Alert

If you have any questions or think that you are eligible to apply for SSR, please contact OGS to request an appointment with a Designated School Official (DSO) by calling +1-617-373-2310 or stopping by the Boston campus at 354 Richards Hall.

Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

The designation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) is the Department of Homeland Security Secretary’s decision to provide specific protections to eligible nationals of certain countries (or parts of countries) who are already inside the United States. An application for TPS must be filed with USCIS.

Overview of TPS (includes countries currently designated for TPS)

TPS is a personal petition to USCIS, thus OGS recommends that students who wish to apply for TPS work with an immigration attorney. If you have a successful TPS petition and need to discuss how to continue to maintain your F-1 status, please schedule an appointment with a Designated School Official/DSO (F-1 students) or Alternate Responsible Officer/ARO (J-1 Students) by calling +1-617-373-2310 or stopping by the Boston campus at 354 Richards Hall.

Employment Outside the U.S.

Students who are physically located outside of the U.S. while working for a non-U.S. employer do not require work authorization from OGS. Authorization must be given for work that physically takes place within the U.S. or takes place abroad but for U.S. employers. This may include students on Global Co-op.
NOTE: If you are returning to the U.S. while working abroad or on international co-op to perform work for a short period while you are physically located in the U.S. (such as a business trip or conference), this would require authorization. Please reach out to OGS for advising if you believe this is your situation.

As always, when traveling abroad, it is important to make sure you are checking your I-20 before leaving the U.S. to see if you will need a new travel signature. Please fill out a Travel Signature Request Form or check our website for travel signature session times and dates.
While it is not required for students to bring any extra documentation, some students going on global co-op may want to bring a letter with them when re-entering the U.S., that explains why they have been outside of the country. Below is a sample letter you may modify and sign yourself to bring with you. In addition, OGS recommends you bring an official transcript with you to show your enrollment in classes while you are abroad.

Unauthorized experiential activity

Students cannot start experiential activities outside the classroom without first obtaining appropriate employment authorization from OGS (Curricular Practical Training (CPT), Pre-Completion Optional Practical Training (Pre-OPT), Academic Training (AT), etc.). Unauthorized experiential activity where CPT/Pre-OPT/AT is required and not obtained will place the student in serious violation of their F-1 or J-1 status and may result in their SEVIS record termination.
Students must contact OGS for an appointment if they have questions about what qualifies as unauthorized activity, or if they believe they have engaged in unauthorized experiential activities where employment authorization is required. Please call our office at +1-617-373-2310 or stop by 354 Richards Hall in Boston to schedule an appointment with a Designated School Official/DSO (F-1 Students) or Alternate Responsible Officer/ARO (J-1 Students).

F-1 Post-Completion Optional Practical Training

F-1 students may apply to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (Post-OPT) work authorization, which helps them apply their classroom learning to the real-world.

F-1 STEM EXTENSIONS FOR POST-COMPLETION OPTIONAL PRACTICAL TRAINING

F-1 students who receive Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) degrees and meet certain requirements are eligible to apply for a 24-month extension of their Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT).
Not sure if you’re eligible for STEM OPT? Review the Applying for STEM OPT page and check the STEM-eligible CIP code list. If you have additional questions please contact OGS.

J-1 Academic Training (AT)

Eligible J-1 students may apply for Academic Training (AT), a type of employment authorization granted J-1 Students to complement their programs of study in the U.S.

J-1 Academic Training
Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (Post-OPT) is a type of employment authorization adjudicated by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). It is available to eligible F-1 students for the purpose of gaining practical experience directly related to their program of study. A Post-OPT application first requires an OPT recommendation on a student's Form I-20, then a timely application to USCIS for final adjudication. If successful, USCIS will issue an Employment Authorization Document (EAD).

IMPORTANT: Biometrics Appointments are NOT required for Post-Completion OPT/STEM Extension OPT I-765 Applications
On July 12th, the USCIS implemented a feature on I-765 applications called "myProgress" that will eventually allow OPT/STEM applications to see more detail about their pending applications. Unfortunately, there is currently a glitch with this feature showing a biometrics appointment requirement. Please note that you can disregard this as biometrics appointments are NOT required for I-765 applicants in the C03B and C03C eligibility categories for OPT/STEM OPT. Additionally, the estimated processing times are NOT accurate, as this is taking into account estimated times for all types of I-765 applications, not just OPT/STEM OPT.

Eligibility

Students may apply for a maximum of 12-months of Post-Completion OPT upon completion of each higher degree level. Only one Post-Completion OPT application is allowed per academic degree level (i.e. Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD).
You may apply for Post-Completion OPT only if all of the following criteria have been met:

You have maintained a valid F-1 student status
You have been enrolled full-time for at least one academic year
You have completed fewer than 365 days of full-time Curricular Practical Training (CPT) at the degree level for which you are applying for OPT
You have completed all coursework (may be in final stages of thesis/dissertation)
You are inside the U.S.

Note: If you depart the U.S. before your OPT application has been filed, received and receipted by the USCIS, you become ineligible to apply for Post-Completion OPT if your program has ended.

Eligibility Video »

Post-OPT Application Timeline

You may apply to USCIS for Post-Completion OPT work authorization no earlier than 90 days prior to your program completion date. Post-OPT applications cannot be submitted to USCIS later than 60 days after the program completion date (i.e. during the 60-day grace period).
OPT Application Timeline

Important reminder about Your Program Completion Date
The program end date on your I-20 is an estimated program end date, which may be different from your actual program end date. You must apply for OPT based on your last registered term. For immigration purposes, program completion date corresponds with the last term of enrollment, not necessarily the date of the graduation ceremony or degree conferral date.
For example, if you finish all of your courses in May, but your degree conferral is in August, your I-20 end date will be a May date if you have no registration over the summer.
PhD student Program Completion Dates
Students in the PhD program may choose the date of completion based on any of the following dates:

Dissertation defense date, or
Dissertation/correction submission date, or
End of last registered term

Choosing Your Post-OPT Start Date

If you have not used any Pre-Completion OPT time, you may request up to 12-months of Post-Completion OPT. You must request a start date within the 60-day grace period of your program. You select your own start and end date for OPT (even if you do not yet have a job offer).
Here are some general suggestions to help you make the best decision for your situation:

If you have a job offer and your job starts during your 60-day grace period, use the job start date (or earlier) as your requested start of OPT
If you have a job offer and it starts after your 60-day grace period, use the latest date possible (59th day of grace period) for your OPT start date

Reminder: Students are not eligible to begin working until the Post-OPT has been approved by USCIS, they have received their EAD, and the start date on the EAD has arrived.

Application Timeline & Start Date Selection Video »

Note for PhD Students

If a PhD student has completed all their coursework but is in the final stages of thesis/dissertation, immigration regulations allow the student to apply for either Pre-Completion OPT or Post-Completion OPT while completing their thesis/dissertation.
In this case, the PhD student and their college need to determine the end date of program completion, and the student’s I-20 will be updated to reflect it as the completion date of the program.
If you choose to apply for Post-Completion OPT while completing thesis/dissertation:

You must fulfill the reporting requirements of Post-Completion OPT
Days you do not have a job count toward 90 days of unemployment time
You cannot request program extension even if your thesis/dissertation is not completed after Post-Completion OPT is expired

Mailing Your Application to USCIS (If not filing Online)

USCIS recommends filing online. However, if you choose to file your application with USCIS via a mail service, please review these instructions.

Guidance for Mailing a Post-OPT Application to USCIS

We strongly recommend that you make copies of your complete application for your records before mailing your application to USCIS.
Once you have your documents and I-20 for Post-Completion OPT and you have copied all documentation and assembled the packet, you must send it to the USCIS address below. However its always best practice to confirm the most up-to-date USCIS Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765 directly on the USCIS website. It is recommended you mail your OPT packet through certified mail which includes a tracking number and guaranteed delivery date.
Effective 01/08/2021, you will mail your application to the USCIS Chicago lockbox:
For U.S. Postal Service deliveries:
Attn: I-765 C03
P.O. Box 805373
Chicago, IL 60680-5374
For courier service deliveries (non-U.S. Postal Service: FedEx, UPS, and DHL):
USCIS
Attn: I-765 C03 (Box 805373)
131 South Dearborn – 3rd Floor
Chicago, IL 60603-5517
eShipGlobal mailing option
eShipGlobal offers a shipping service for international students sending their OPT/STEM application to USCIS. Students can choose their carrier (UPS, FedEx, or USPS) and type of delivery (next day, 2-day, etc.) and ship at discounted rates. This service is not a Northeastern service. All inquiries should be directed to eShipGlobal directly.
USCIS Processing Times

USCIS advertises normal processing time for OPT requests as being around 100 days.
You can check current processing times on USCIS’s website

After the documentation leaves the respective Lockbox, it is forwarded to the USCIS Service Center. About fifteen days after USCIS receives your application for Post-Completion OPT, you should receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) from USCIS.

What Happens After I Submit my Application to USCIS?

You should receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) from USCIS. You can look up your case status online using the case number.

If you file online you will receive this receipt notice electronically within a day or two. If you file by mail you should receive this notice within 2-weeks.
If you submitted the G1145 form with your application, you will be informed electronically by email and/or text
If you paid for your OPT fee by personal check, the back of the cashed check will have the number. You may obtain a copy of this check from your bank.
You may contact the USCIS call center at 800-375-5283.

You can check USCIS current OPT and STEM OPT estimated processing times on the USCIS website. (Select Form: “I-765” Form Category: “Based on a request by a qualified F-1 academic student [(c)(3)]” Service Center: “Potomac Service Center”.)
Once USCIS adjudicates your application and your Post-OPT is approved, expect to first receive an approval notice and then an EAD.
You must not work until you receive your EAD card and you may only work within the dates specified on the EAD card.

The EAD card, not your approval notice, is your work authorization documentation.

Note: Your application will remain in “pending” status until a decision has been made on your application (this may be a few months). Adjudication of your application is completed by USCIS. Therefore, USCIS will inform you directly of the official receipt, request for additional information, and the decision on your application. Please be aware that this is a normal processing timeframe, and regrettably, OGS is unable to assist in expediting any requests.
OGS is here to guide you if you receive any communication from USCIS that requires response (request for additional information, denial, etc.).

Important Reminders

USCIS must receive the OPT application within 30 days of the issuing OPT recommendation by OGS; if the application is not received by USCIS within 30 days after the issuance of the OPT I-20, the application will be denied (this is the most common reason for the denial of Post-OPT)
Do not mail in your application so that USCIS receives it more than 90 days before your program end date or more than 60 days after the program end date. (Applications received outside of these times will be denied)
If your entire application is returned to you, consult with an OGS Advisor before resubmitting the application; your application may not be considered “received” and you may need a new I-20 with OPT recommendation
Do not submit an OPT application to USCIS prior to obtaining I-20 with OPT recommendation
Do not wait for a job offer in order to start the OPT application process
Make sure that the address on your OPT application is valid for receiving mail at all times during OPT processing
Students must abide by all reporting requirements while on Post-Completion OPT.

Employment during Post-OPT

It is the responsibility of the student to determine if the accepted employment is related to his/her program of study and to report all employment to SEVP.
The following criteria must be met when you engage in work during Post-OPT:

You must work a minimum of 20 hours per week
All work must be directly related to your program of study

When considering work opportunities, the following employment types are permissible for OPT:

Paid or unpaid employment
Multiple employers: you may work for multiple employers while on Post-OPT. All work obtained must be directly related to your program of study
Work for hire: This is often referred to as 1099 employment. You can contract yourself out to a company. (This is similar to working as a freelancer)
Self-employed/business owner: You may start your own business. (Consult with a lawyer in order to find out what is needed to start a company)
Employment through an agency or consulting firm: You may work for a placement agency or consulting firm. (This experience will usually involve temporary or contract work)
Volunteering: Students on Post-OPT may work as volunteers as long as the work is related to their major field of study and does not violate labor laws

Note: Guidelines for STEM employers differ; please review our STEM OPT page for more information.

Travel While on Post-OPT

Students on Post-Completion OPT are still in F-1 status and must maintain all F-1 eligibility documents in order to travel abroad. In order to re-enter the U.S., the following documents are required:

A passport that is valid for 6 months from the date of your return to the U.S.
A valid F-1 student visa
A valid I-20 with OPT recommendation and a valid travel signature on page 2*

*Travel signatures are valid for 6 months while you are on OPT.

A valid EAD
Proof of employment (an offer letter can be used)

If you are not currently employed, you should not travel outside of the U.S. as you may be denied entry by Customs and Border Protection (CBP)

Given the information above, travel before an EAD card has been approved and received is not advisable. Note: If you depart the U.S. before your OPT application has been filed, received, and receipted by the USCIS, you become ineligible to apply for Post-Completion OPT if your program has ended.
Please see OGS’ page on International Travel for more information.

Frequently Asked Questions

×

My application was rejected and returned to me because of a missing signature on I-765 or an issue with my check/money order. What do I do?

Do NOT mail the application yet. Please complete the Optional Practical Training Issue Reporting Form in Optional Practical Training Central. You should also contact OGS and make an appointment with an OGS advisor. You will most likely need a new OPT recommendation and will need to submit a new OPT application to USCIS.
You cannot resubmit your application if there is any chance your I-20 with OPT recommendation will be more than 30 days old when it is received by USCIS; this would result in a denial.

I received a Request For Evidence from USCIS. What do I do?

You are required to respond to Request For Evidence by the deadline specified on the letter. If you can prepare the document(s) they ask for, you may respond on your own. If you have any questions, you may make an appointment with an OGS advisor. Please also make sure that you submit your Request For Evidence to the Optional Practical Training Issue Reporting e-form at Optional Practical Training Central.

How do I change my mailing address while my OPT application is pending with USCIS?

While your application is still pending with USCIS, follow the instructions here.
If you are moving and not just updating the address to which your EAD card should be mailed, you must also update the OGS with your new address using the Address Update Form.

How do I withdraw my OPT application?

If your application is still pending with USCIS, and you decide not to pursue OPT, you may withdraw your application. In this case, you will need to mail a letter to request withdrawal of your application to the USCIS address that’s listed on your receipt notice, and a copy of your receipt notice.
The letter should include the following elements:

Note “Re: I-765 Withdrawal” on the letter
Include biographical information to identify the student, including name, date of birth, and SEVIS number
Reference the receipt number for the I-765 application (from the Form I-797 receipt notice); a copy of the receipt notice can also be helpful
Specific request that the Form I-765 application for OPT be withdrawn
Student’s signature

Once your application is withdrawn, you should receive the withdrawal acknowledgement letter from USCIS. If you do not receive anything within 1 month, please contact OGS.
NOTE: If you withdraw your OPT application after your program has ended, your 60-day grace period will go into effect as of the end date of your I-20. If 60 days has passed since the end of your program, your record will auto-complete when your OPT application is withdrawn.

Can I request for my application to be expedited by USCIS?

Although USCIS generally does not accept expedite processing, you may try including a job offer letter and a cover letter explaining your job is expected to start on a certain day and send them along with the required documents for the Post-Completion OPT application.
If you already have submitted the application to USCIS, you may call customer service and ask how to request the expedite processing.
Disclaimer: There is no guarantee that USCIS will honor your request. It is solely the student’s responsibility to prepare the documents and submit the expedite request. We recommend that you talk to your employer about changing your employment start date to a later date.

My OPT application was denied. What can I do?

If your OPT application is denied, please wait to receive your denial notice in the mail. Once you receive it, make an appointment to meet with an OGS advisor to discuss your situation.

My OPT application has been pending for more than 110 days. What can I do?

Please visit the Department of Homeland Security website to review what to do if your application has been pending for more than 110 days.
If you have submitted a request to USCIS to review your case and your case has been pending over 110 days, please submit the “Optional Practical Training Issue Reporting” e-form in Optional Practical Training Central. In this e-form, you will be asked what day you submitted your request to USCIS.

I did not get my EAD card in the mail after receiving the approval notice. What do I do?

Find your tracking number by checking your USCIS Case Status, then contact the United States Postal Office to see if they can locate your EAD card if it already says “delivered” status.
If your card is not received within 2-3 weeks of receiving your approval notice or seeing that your case status shows your card was “delivered,” then you can make an e-request through USCIS. Please note: This e-request may result in a response from USCIS or it may result in the production of an EAD card; the production of a new card is estimated to take approximately 120 days.
For questions about this e-request, please contact USCIS Customer Service at:
1-800-375-5283 or 1-800-767-1833
If it is determined that your EAD card is lost in the mail and you do not want to wait for a response from USCIS, you will have to apply for a replacement of EAD card by submitting the following documents to the lockbox, as you did for your initial application. Processing times will be the same as processing times for the initial OPT application approval.

Letter explaining what happened to previously issued card (include police report if applicable)
I-765 (check the box that indicates that you are applying for a “Replacement” card)
G-1145
$410 check, money order or bank check made payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Copies of previous I-20s
Copy of F-1 visa
Copy of passport
Passport photos
Approval Notice of Optional Practical Training/Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Optional Practical Training (STEM OPT)

What happens if my EAD card has incorrect information on it?

If your EAD card was processed by the Potomac Service Center:
If your Form I-765 was approved by the Potomac Service Center and your EAD card contains incorrect information due to a USCIS error, you must return the original card along with a detailed explanation of the error and supporting documentation to the Potomac Service Center at:
Potomac Service Center
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services
2200 Potomac Center Drive, Stop 2425
Arlington, VA 20598-2425
In these cases, you do not need to submit a new Form I-765 and filing fee. The Potomac Service Center will issue a corrected EAD card within 30 days of receiving your EAD card that contains incorrect information.
If you return your Potomac Service Center-approved EAD card and the Potomac Service Center determines your card contains incorrect information that is not due to USCIS error, the Potomac Service Center will return the EAD card to you. In this case, you will have to follow the process detailed in the Replacement Employment Authorization Document section of the Employment Authorization Document page to have your card corrected.
If you do not find the information you need through online services and need further assistance, you may contact the National Customer Service Center at 1-800-375-5283 or 1-800-767-1833 Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD).
If your EAD card was processed at a Service Center other than Potomac, call USCIS Customer Service at 1-800-375-5283 or 1-800-767-1833 and ask for instructions.
https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/contact-us/national-customer-service-center

What do I do if I lose my EAD card?

If your card is lost or stolen while you are on OPT, we advise you apply for a replacement card. You will have to apply for a replacement EAD card by submitting the following documents to the lockbox, as you did for your initial application:

Letter explaining what happened to previously issued card (include police report if applicable)
I-765 (check the box that indicates that you are applying for a “Replacement” card)
G-1145
$410 check, money order or bank check made payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Copies of previous I-20s
Copy of F-1 visa
Copy of passport
Passport photos
Approval Notice of Optional Practical Training/Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Optional Practical Training (STEM OPT)
Copy of EAD card (if available)

My OPT duration is less than 12 months. Is this a mistake?

Per regulations, your OPT end date must be within 14 months of your program end date. Depending on the OPT application approval date, your OPT duration may be less than 12 months.
Reporting Requirements

F-1 Students on an approved period of Post-OPT must abide by specific reporting requirements. All changes/updates must be reported to Student and Exchange Visitor Program Portal (SEVP Portal). You will receive an email with instructions on creating your SEVP Portal once your Post-OPT has been approved and within a few days of the start date on their EAD.
The following must be reported to the SEVP Portal within 10-days of the change or update:

Changes to your address or contact information
New employment

Name of company
Address of company

This is the address from where you are conducting your work

Start and end dates with company
Description of how the work is related to your course of study/major

Changes to your current employment

If for any reason you are unable to report via the SEVP Portal, you may report your changes/updates and any issues with the SEVP Portal to OGS via the OPT Issue Reporting e-form found on the Optional Practical Training Central page in myOGS.

Reporting Requirements Video »

Failure to Report
It is your personal responsibility to provide all contact and employment information to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) Portal. Failing to report Post-OPT employment and/or changes to your employment may result in the automatic termination of your SEVIS record.

Additional Reporting Requirements While on Post-OPT

I’m going to discontinue Post-OPT and depart the U.S.

You must submit the Request to Complete Optional Practical Training & SEVIS Record e-form with a copy of a flight itinerary indicating you have/will depart the U.S.

I’m going to change my status from F-1 to another status (e.g. H-1B)

You must report this change to the OGS using the appropriate e-form.

I’m going to begin a new program of study at Northeastern or Transfer to another SEVP-certified institution in the U.S.

You must update your employment end date in the SEVP portal.
You must request to have your SEVIS record transferred or request a Change of Degree Level I-20

Unemployment During Post-OPT

You are permitted to have up to 90 days of unemployment during the Post-OPT period (within the dates of authorization on your EAD). If you exceed 90 days of unemployment, then you are considered out of status; there is no additional grace period after these 90 days. These 90 days will start accruing from the start date listed on your EAD and will stop once you begin working and update your employment in the SEVP Portal.
Please note that you are permitted 90 days total throughout your Post-Completion OPT period, and if you are eligible and approved for STEM OPT, any days of unemployment that you did not use during your Post-Completion OPT period may be carried over to your STEM OPT period.
If you are not currently employed, you should not travel outside of the U.S. as you may be denied entry by Customs and Border Protection

Exceeding Unemployment Days
If employment is not updated in the SEVP Portal within 90 days of the start date on your EAD card, or you accrue more than 90 days of unemployment during your Post-OPT period, your SEVIS record may be automatically terminated. It is your responsibility to keep a personal record of all OPT activity.

Invalidating your Post-OPT

Your Post-OPT will be invalidated if you:

Start a new program of study
Transfer your SEVIS record to a new college or university
Change your immigration/visa status
Enter the U.S. using any visa status other than an F-1
Violate your immigration status

Studying while on Post-OPT

This is only allowed for recreational and professional development purposes—enrolling in a degree program will invalidate your OPT.

SEVP Portal

The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) Portal is a tool for you as an F-1 student to report your contact information and employer information directly to SEVIS while on Post-Completion OPT. You will be able to see your information in the portal as it is reported in SEVIS and will be able to update it as needed. You will be able to make changes to your address, telephone number, and employer information.
If you experience any of the following issues, you must complete the OPT Issue Reporting section of OGS Post-Completion OPT Central:

Your SEVP portal is inactive even though your Post-OPT has been approved and you received your EAD
You are locked out of SEVP Portal
You are unable to log into SEVP Portal

The 24-month STEM OPT Extension is a type of employment authorization adjudicated by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). It is available to eligible F-1 students for the purpose of gaining practical experience directly related to their program of study. A STEM Extension application requires a student to be on an approved period of Post-Completion OPT, to have an E-verify employer that provides a student with formal training and learning, a STEM OPT recommendation on the Form I-20, then a timely application to USCIS for final adjudication. If successful, USCIS will issue an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) granting the student 24-months of work authorization.

Eligibility

All four of the below criteria must be met in order for a student to be eligible for the 24-month Optional Practical Training extension:

Students who are on Post-Completion OPT; and
Who have earned a bachelor’s, master’s, or PhD (certificate programs are not eligible) in a field included on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s list of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields within the last 10 years (see below for more details about how to find out if your degree is STEM eligible); and
Who are employed for more than 20 hours per week in a paid job directly related to his/her field of study; and
Who are working for an employer that is enrolled in the U.S. Government’s E-Verify program.

STEM Eligible Degrees
To verify STEM eligibility, look at the code listed under “Primary Major” on Page 1 of your I-20 and compare that code in the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) column of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security STEM Designated Degree Programs list. If your major code is on the list, then it is considered to be STEM eligible.
Please note: the DHS STEM Designated Degree Programs list was recently updated on July 12, 2023. Please be sure you are accessing the most recent STEM list linked above, which can also be found on the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement website on this page in the “Resources” section under the “DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List and CIP Code Nomination Process” tab. Students whose CIP code has been added to the list as of July 2023 will receive direct notification from OGS.

STEM Extension Application Timeline

Students may apply to USCIS for the STEM OPT Extension work authorization no earlier than 90-days prior to the Post-OPT EAD expiration date. Accordingly, OGS will process a STEM recommendation I-20 no more than three months and three weeks in advance of your current OPT expiration date.
Completed applications must be received by USCIS before the expiration date on the Post-OPT EAD to be properly (timely) filed. USCIS will not accept applications for the STEM Extension that are received beyond the expiration date of the Post-OPT EAD.

COMPLETING THE FORM I-983

All students must submit a completed Form I-983 to OGS in order to receive the STEM OPT Extension recommendation on their Form I-20. Students should reference the official USCIS Instructions of the Form I-983 and the resources available on the Study in the States website as they complete the I-983.
Additionally, OGS has prepared a supplemental guide to filling out the Form I-983 to assist students as they complete their application for the STEM OPT Extension. Because the STEM OPT Extension application is a personal petition to USCIS, OGS is unable to advise on how to complete each section of the form. However, this guide offers clarification on some of the I-983 instructions provided by USCIS.
Please Note: All fields on the Form I-983 must be completed in full when you submit your STEM Extension request to OGS. This resource does not provide guidance on how to complete every field of every section of the I-983; rather, it has been created to help guide students through the most frequently questioned sections.

Mailing your application to USCIS (if not applying online)

USCIS recommends filing online. However, if you choose to file your application with USCIS via a mail service, please review these instructions.

Guidance for Mailing a STEM OPT Extension Application to USCIS

We strongly recommend that you make copies of your complete application for your records before mailing your application to USCIS.
Once you have your documents and I-20 for the 24-month STEM extension, and you have copied all documentation and assembled the packet, you must send it to the USCIS address below. However, its always best practice to confirm the most up-to-date USCIS Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765 directly on the USCIS website. It is recommended that you mail your STEM packet via certified/guaranteed mail and obtain a receipt with tracking number.
Mail your application to the USCIS Chicago lockbox:
For U.S. Postal Service deliveries:
Attn: I-765 C03
P.O. Box 805373
Chicago, IL 60680-5374
For courier service deliveries (non-U.S. Postal Service: FedEx, UPS, and DHL):
USCIS
Attn: I-765 C03 (Box 805373)
131 South Dearborn – 3rd Floor
Chicago, IL 60603-5517
eShipGlobal Mailing Option:
eShipGlobal offers a shipping service for international students sending their OPT/STEM application to USCIS. Students can choose their carrier (UPS, FedEx, or USPS) and type of delivery (next day, 2-day, etc.) and ship at discounted rates. This service is not a Northeastern service. All inquiries should be directed to eShipGlobal directly.
USCIS Processing Times:

USCIS advertises normal processing time for STEM OPT requests as being around 100 days.
You can check current processing times on USCIS’s website

After the documentation leaves the respective Lockbox, it is forwarded to the USCIS Service Center. About fifteen days after USCIS receives your application for the 24-month OPT extension, you should receive a Form I-797, a receipt notice from USCIS.

What happens after I submit my application to USCIS?

You should receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) from USCIS. You can look up your case status online using the case number.

If you file online you will receive this receipt notice electronically within a day or two. If you file by mail you should receive this notice within 2-weeks.

You can also check USCIS current OPT and STEM OPT estimated processing times on the USCIS website. (Select Form: “I-765” Form Category: “Based on a request by a qualified F-1 academic student [(c)(3)]” Service Center: “Potomac Service Center”.)
While your 24-month OPT STEM extension application is pending, you may continue working for up to 180 days (6 months)*
Once USCIS adjudicates your application and your STEM OPT is approved, expect to first receive an approval notice and then an EAD.

*The Code of Federal Regulations, 8CFR 214.2(f)(11)(i)(C) and 8CFR 247a.12(c)(6)(iv), automatically extend your work authorization while the application is pending. However, you must have already submitted all the appropriate documentation to USCIS and paid the filing fee prior to the expiration date of your Post-Completion OPT.

Important reminders and most common application mistakes

Do not submit STEM OPT application to USCIS prior to obtaining I-20 with STEM OPT recommendation
USCIS must receive the STEM OPT application within 60 days of the STEM OPT recommendation by the OGS; if the application is not received by USCIS within 60 days after the issuance of STEM OPT I-20, the application will be denied
Do not mail in your application so that USCIS receives it more than 90 days before your OPT EAD end date. Your application must be received by USCIS before your OPT EAD expires. Applications received outside of these times will be denied
If your entire application is returned to you, consult with an OGS Advisor before resubmitting the application; your application may not be considered “received” and you may need a new I-20 with STEM OPT recommendation
Make sure that the address on I-765 is valid for receiving mail at all times while your STEM OPT is pending

Employment during STEM OPT

Restrictions on types of employment permitted during 24-month STEM OPT include:

Any job the student has on STEM OPT must be related to his/her program of study
Students on STEM OPT are only allowed to work for e-verified employers
Volunteering/unpaid employment is not permitted during the STEM OPT extension
Self-employment is not permitted during the STEM OPT extension
Students on STEM OPT may not work part time for any employer (20 or less hours/week). Working for more than one employer is only permitted if each job is more than 20 hours per week and each employer is E-verified.
Employment must constitute a bona fide employer-employee relationship. The employer that signs the Form I-983 must be the same entity that employs the student and provides the practical training experience. You can read more about what constitutes an employer-employee relationship via the STEM OPT guidelines provided by USCIS.
If you have questions about whether your employment arrangement meets STEM eligibility requirements, please consult with your employer and legal counsel. (Please refer to Study in the States for information regarding STEM eligibility requirements)

Travel During the STEM Extension

If you travel outside the U.S. or its territories during the approved STEM OPT extension period, to re-enter the country, you must present the following documents at the port of entry:

A passport which should be valid for at least six months from the date you return to the U.S. and your unexpired F-1 visa stamp
I-20 with a valid travel signature. (While you are participating in OPT, travel signatures are valid for only 6 months)
Your Employment Authorization Document card for STEM OPT extension*
Proof of employment

If you are not currently employed, you should not travel outside of the U.S. as you may be denied entry by Customs and Border Protection

*If your STEM OPT application is pending and you plan to travel abroad, please make sure your Post-OPT Employment Authorization Document is still valid. If your Post-OPT Employment Authorization Document is already expired, traveling abroad is NOT recommended.
If you travel during your OPT or STEM period and your F-1 visa has expired, you will need to obtain a new F-1 visa. While on OPT/STEM, you are still considered to be an F-1 student. Expect to show similar documents as the first time you applied for your visa (check with your local US embassy for requirements). Additionally, you should have your valid STEM EAD card, I-20 with STEM recommendation on page 2 and travel signature within 6 months, passport valid within 6 months, and proof of employment. Please see Renewing your F-1 visa for further instructions on how to renew your visa.

Frequently Asked Questions »

Frequently Asked Questions

×

Am I eligible for the STEM Extension based on a previous degree?

Students may be eligible to apply for the STEM Extension based on a previously earned STEM degree from an accredited U.S. institution (must be within 10 years of completing the degree).
For example: A student receives a bachelor’s degree in Engineering, but did not request STEM OPT employment authorization based on that degree. The student then receives an MBA and obtains authorization for 12-months of Post-OPT based on the MBA. This student may be eligible to apply for 24-month STEM OPT at the end of the 12-month Post-OPT period based on their MBA.
Any students that believe they are eligible for STEM based on a previous degree should make an appointment with an OGS advisor.

Can I be authorized for the STEM OPT Extension more than once?

The 24-month extension of OPT is available to each student at two non-consecutive periods of time.  Each STEM extension must meet the above-listed STEM eligibility requirements.
Please note: This rule is different from the “standard” 12-month OPT, under which students can be approved for multiple OPT periods for each higher degree earned in the U.S. (i.e. bachelor’s, then master’s, then doctoral).

What is the E-Verify program?

E-Verify is a database system operated by the Department of Homeland Security in partnership with the Social Security Administration. It allows participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly-hired employees. E-Verify is currently voluntary in most states. For more information click here.

Where do I mail my STEM application?

The current filing address is listed below.  However its always best practice to confirm the most up-to-date USCIS Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765 directly on the USCIS website.  It is recommended that you mail your STEM packet through certified mail which includes a tracking number and guaranteed delivery date.
Effective 01/08/2021, you will mail your application to the USCIS Chicago lockbox:
For U.S. Postal Service deliveries:
USCIS
PO Box 805373
Chicago, IL 60680
For courier service deliveries (non-U.S. Postal Service:  FedEx, UPS, and DHL):
USCIS
Attn: I-765 C03
131 South Dearborn – 3rd Floor
Chicago, IL 60603-5517

Can I work while my 24-month application is pending with USCIS?

Yes, a student who files a timely STEM OPT extension application can continue working while the STEM OPT application is pending, for up to 180 days beyond the expiration of the student’s standard post-completion OPT. All work done during this 180-day time period is considered STEM OPT extension time that counts towards the 24-month total.

Can I change employers while my 24-month application is pending with USCIS?

It should be noted that changing your employer while applying for STEM can potentially create delays in the application process.  However, if you need to change employers while your STEM application is pending with USCIS, please review the instructions in the Reporting STEM Extension OPT section.

I received a Request for Evidence from USCIS. What should I do?

You are required to respond to the RFE by the deadline specified on the letter. If you can prepare the document(s) they ask for, you may respond on your own. If you are unsure of how to handle the RFE, please complete the STEM OPT Issue Reporting e-form and upload a copy of the RFE.

Can I apply for STEM OPT extension if I have a pending H-1B application?

Yes, you may apply for the 24 month OPT STEM extension while you are also in your period of Cap Gap extension.
If you choose to continue on your 24 month extension rather than change to H-1B, you must ensure your employer requests the withdrawal of your H- 1B petition prior to October 1. If this is not done, your H-1B status will begin on October 1, and your eligibility for the 24 month STEM extension will be cancelled.
If you choose to change to H-1B and not proceed with your 24 month STEM extension application, you should send a letter to the USCIS service center reviewing your application and request that your STEM application is withdrawn.  Your letter should include your name, SEVIS ID, receipt number, reason for withdrawal, and your signature (in ink).

Can I study while on approved STEM OPT?

Taking a class while on STEM may be permissible as long as your primary activity remains Practical Training.  Moving to a new degree program would automatically invalidate your STEM Extension OPT (i.e. If you start studying at the PhD level while working on STEM based on a Master’s degree, you would invalidate your STEM).  Please discuss with an OGS Advisor prior to taking any classes while on OPT or STEM.
Reporting Requirements

F-1 Students on an approved period of STEM OPT must abide by specific reporting requirements. All changes/updates must be reported within 10-days of the change.

Changes to address or contact information

Find more information below under: “Changing Employers During the STEM Extension”
If your application for a STEM Extension EAD is still pending with USCIS and you have not yet received your EAD you can find more information below under “Changing Employers During the STEM Extension”

Validation Reports Every 6-months

Report 6-month validations and self-evaluations by submitting the STEM Validation (6, 12, 18 and 24 months) form in myOGS

6, 12, 18, & 24-Month Validation Reporting Requirements

6 month-validations are mandatory and must be submitted 6-months, 12-months, 18-months, and 24-months after the start of the approved STEM Extension period. Validations may be submitted no sooner than 30 days before the validation due date, and no later than 15 days after.
All validations must be reported directly to OGS via the STEM Validation e-form

6-month validation report

Confirm to OGS the validity of the following information: legal name, residential address, employer name and address, job title, and status of current employment

12-month validation report

Confirm to OGS the validity of the following information: legal name, residential address, employer name and address, job title, and status of current employment
Submit the Form I-983 with “Evaluation on Student Progress” section (top half of page 5 of the I-983) completed and signed

Note: Even if you have not completed 12 months of employment with your current employer you must still submit the 12-month evaluation

18-month validation report

Confirm to OGS the validity of the following information: legal name, residential address, employer name and address, job title, and status of current employment

24-month validation report

Submit the Form I-983 with “Final Evaluation on Student Progress” section (bottom half of page 5 of the I-983)  completed and signed

If you leave an employer at any time during the 24-month STEM Extension you must also complete the “Final Evaluation on Student Progress” section for each employer

Note: If you have more than one employer while on the STEM Extension, you will need to submit validation reports for each employer. Please use the “Additional Comments” section in the STEM Validation e-form to make a note of this so the assigned OGS advisor can reach out to you directly for confirmation, as the e-form will only allow reporting on one employer.
Failure to Report
There typically are no immediate consequences for failing to submit the validation reports. However, there are two potential consequences for missing these reporting requirements:

An automatic system termination of your SEVIS record for “Failure to Report While on OPT” is possible. This decision is at the discretion of USCIS/SEVP officials. Note: OGS will NOT terminate your record due to a missed validation report
USCIS/SEVP may question your failure to submit validation reports during an application for future immigration benefits (e.g. H-1B). Your attorney would be advised to assist you with these inquiries

Even if you know that you missed the deadline and that your STEM Validation e-form will be denied, the OGS recommends submitting the e-form anyways as evidence that you made an effort to comply with the reporting requirements.

Changing Employers During the STEM Extension

You may decide to change employers while their STEM OPT Extension is pending with USCIS and/or after the STEM OPT Extension has been approved by USCIS. Anytime you decide  to change employers, you must report all changes within 10-days.
Changing Employers while the STEM Extension is Pending with USCIS
A student who has a pending STEM OPT application can change employers, but the new employer must also be an E-Verify Employer and the position must meet all STEM requirements. The student must report the change of employer to the USCIS by doing the following:

The new employer and the student must complete a new Form I-983
The student must submit the STEM Extension I-20 Request to OGS and select the option ‘My STEM is pending and my employer has changed’

This e-form will require you to upload the completed I-983 for your new employer as well as the I-983 for your previous employer with the “Final Evaluation on Student Progress” section completed

You are permitted 60-days of unemployment during the STEM Extension period. This is in addition to the 90-days of unemployment that you are granted during the Post-OPT period; up to 150 days of total unemployment. While on STEM OPT you may use unused unemployment days from your Post-OPT period.
If you are not currently employed, you should not travel outside of the U.S. as you may be denied entry by Customs and Border Protection.

Exceeding Unemployment during the STEM Extension
If you accrue more than the aggregate limit of 150 days of unemployment during your Post-OPT and STEM Extension periods, your SEVIS record may be automatically terminated.

SEVP Portal

The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) Portal remains available for you while on the STEM Extension to report changes to your address, telephone number, and employer information.
While on the STEM Extension, you may also use the SEVP Portal to update general employer information including:

Supervisor name and contact information
Job title
Description of how job is related to major

However, you may not:

Edit your employer’s name and address
Add a new employer or remove an existing employer
Edit EIN (Employment Identification Number)
Edit employer start date (end date may be edited)

If you experience any of the following issues, you must complete the STEM OPT Issue Reporting e-form:

SEVP portal is inactive even though your STEM Extension has been approved and you received your EAD
You are locked out of SEVP Portal
You are unable to log into SEVP Portal

When do I need report my 6 month validation?

Once your STEM period has started (the day after your OPT EAD expires), then you must complete the STEM OPT Validation e-form every 6 months.
At the 12 and 24 month mark, you will need to include an Evaluation on Student Progress along with your 6 month validation. These evaluations are found on the final page of your I-983 document. The boxes should only be completed at the 12/24 month mark of your STEM authorization.
The SEVP portal will now send students reminders regarding their STEM validation, so make sure to add SEVP to your safe sender list. Furthermore, you can calculate your own validation periods by adding 6/12/18/24 months from your original STEM approval date.
The STEM validation function is only available to DSOs for a specific window of time, so make sure to submit your validation either before or on the day it is due.

What can be updated in the SEVP Portal for STEM students?

If you are on STEM, then in the SEVP Portal, you can update your Employer general information, including:

Supervisor name and contact information
Job title
Description of how job is related to major
Full-time/part-time employment

You cannot update the following in the SEVP Portal:

Add a new employer or remove an existing employer
Edit EIN (Employment Identification Number) or employer name/address/employer site
Edit employer start date (end date can be edited)

What if my STEM record shows “Inactive” in the SEVP Portal even though I received my STEM EAD card?

If you have already received your STEM EAD card, but your STEM record in the SEVP Portal is showing as “inactive”, then please submit the STEM Issue Reporting e-form. You will be asked to upload a copy of your EAD card.

What do I need to report if I leave an employer?

If you leave your employer, you must submit the Final Evaluation on Student Progress (Page 5 of I-983) by using the I-983 Updates and Self-Evaluation e-form. Remember to add a new employer if you have one to avoid incurring unemployment time.
What is H-1B Status?

The H-1B is temporary employment authorization that is used for nonimmigrant individuals in a specialty occupation. In order to become eligible for H-1B status, an employer must sponsor an individual and submit a petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
Each year, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a limit (cap) of 65,000 new H-1B visas for individuals with a bachelor’s degree or higher being sponsored by a cap-subject employer. 20,000 additional H-1Bs are reserved for individuals with a master’s degree or higher earned at a U.S. college or university. Some H-1B visas are not cap-subject, including but not limited to those employed at institutions of higher education, nonprofit research organizations, or government research organizations. H-1B visas are adjudicated through a randomized system and begin on October 1 for cap-subject employers.
You can learn more about the H-1B Cap Season here.

What is the Cap-Gap Extension?

The Cap–Gap Extension is an automatic extension of F-1 status that may be granted to F-1 students who need to “bridge the gap” between the expiration of their OPT/STEM EAD and the start date of their approved H-1B sponsored by a cap-subject employer.
Because new H-1Bs become effective on October 1 of each year, the Cap-Gap Extension allows eligible F-1 students to remain in the U.S. between the expiration of their OPT/STEM Extension and the start of their H-1B.
You can learn more about H-1B status and the Cap-Gap Extension here.

Cap-Gap Extension Eligibility

Please be aware that the responsibility of the Office of Global Services (OGS) regarding H-1B petitions is minimal.

As an F-1 student, you may be eligible for the Cap-Gap extension if:

You have maintained your F-1 status
You are the beneficiary of an H-1B petition that was timely filed by an employer that is cap-subject
The H-1B petition requests a start date of October 1st and a change of status inside the U.S.

If you have applied for the H-1B via consular processing, you do not qualify for the Cap-Gap Extension.

The Cap-Gap Extension is automatically applied to a student’s SEVIS record. As such OGS is able to provide proof of the extension only if a student has been deemed eligible by USCIS.
If Your H-1B Petition was Filed During Your 60-Day Grace Period:
If your sponsoring employer filed the H-1B petition during your 60-day grace period, your Cap-Gap Extension will allow you to remain in the U.S. until the start date of your H-1B (unless your petition is rejected, denied, or withdrawn). However, your work authorization will not be extended, and you must stop working as of the expiration date on your EAD.
Please Note: Once your SEVIS record completes for the change of status to H-1B, your F-1 status has ended, and OGS is not able to “revert” your status back to F-1.
You can learn more about eligibility for the Cap-Gap Extension here.

How can I Request Proof of my Cap-Gap Extension?

Please fill out this e-form: Cap Gap I-20 Request.
You will need to provide proof of a qualifying “pending” or “approved” H-1B petition. If you are able to do so, OGS will issue you an updated I-20 reflecting your Cap-Gap Extension of status, and extension of OPT/STEM work authorization if applicable.

Can I Apply for the STEM Extension During the Cap-Gap Extension period?

OGS DOES NOT advise students to submit an application for the STEM Extension after the expiration date of your OPT EAD, even when a student has received the Cap-Gap Extension. It is the experience of OGS and other institutions that applications for the STEM Extension have a very high rate of denial when they are submitted to USCIS beyond the OPT EAD expiration date.
If a student chooses to submit an application for the STEM Extension after their Cap-Gap Extension has been applied but before their OPT EAD has expired, they are advised to also submit a letter to USCIS informing them of the date discrepancy that may exist between the actual OPT end date and the Cap Gap Extension end date (September 30). The letter should advise the adjudicators at USCIS that if the STEM Extension is approved, it must be approved based on the actual OPT end date, not based on the end date of the Cap Gap Extension. Please fill out OGS’ inquiry form to request this letter template.
If a student decides to continue on their STEM extension rather than changing to H-1B, they must ensure that the employer requests the withdrawal of the H-1B petition prior to October 1. If this is not done, the H-1B status will begin on October 1 and the student’s eligibility for the STEM OPT extension will be cancelled.
If a student decides to change to H-1B and not proceed with the STEM OPT extension application, the student should send a letter to the USCIS, requesting that the STEM application is withdrawn.

H-1B Reporting

There are many complexities that an F-1 student may experience when changing their status from F-1 to H-1B.
If your status has already changed or will be changing from F-1 to H-1B, please complete the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form. An OGS Designated School Official (DSO) will review the request and review your F-1 SEVIS record to ensure any changes are reflected accurately.
You should fill out this e-form:

To report that your H-1B petition for change of status was approved (I-797A Approval Notice from USCIS)
To report that your H-1B petition for consular processing was approved (I-797B Approval Notice from USCIS) and you have re-entered the U.S. in H-1B status.
To report that your H-1B petition for consular processing was approved (I-797B Approval Notice from USCIS) but you have NOT re-entered the U.S. in H-1B status yet.
To report that your H-1B petition was withdrawn by your employer.

If you received a Request for Evidence (RFE) for your H-1B petition that requires you to provide information related to your F-1 non-immigrant status or academic background, please submit the H-1B RFE Response Request e-form.
If your H-1B petition was denied, please submit the H-1B Denial Notification e-form. OGS will review the denial notice to determine if any institutional support from OGS or Northeastern is appropriate.

Impact of Changing to H-1B from F-1 Status

If you are approved for H-1B change of status, as of the effective date of the H-1B period (October 1 in most cases for cap-subject employers), your F-1 status ends and your SEVIS record automatically completes. Unfortunately, in cases where students lose their H-1B employment (due to layoffs, for example) after they have already changed to H-1B, there are typically no options to reclaim unused OPT/STEM OPT time or to have their previous SEVIS record reactivated. Students should carefully consider this when applying to change to H-1B status, and be prepared that they may need to consult with an immigration attorney for next options if their H-1B employment is terminated, and that simply reverting back to F-1 status is often not possible.
Students whose F-1 status has or will be changing to H-1B status, or whose H-1B employment has been withdrawn, revoked, or denied, should submit the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form (or H-1B Denial Notification e-form) as soon as possible so that OGS may review your case. If your H-1B was withdrawn/revoked/denied and you have questions related to your F-1 status, please also call OGS at +1 617-373-2310 to make an appointment with an OGS advisor.
If your H-1B Employer Withdraws/Revokes Your Petition:

Please review the information provided on the USCIS website.
If your employer can provide evidence that USCIS received the withdrawal notice BEFORE your approved H-1B effective start date, OGS may be able to assist you in submitting a data fix request to SEVP to return your SEVIS record to Active status if you’re otherwise eligible. Please submit the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form so we can review your case.
If your employer did not withdraw your H-1B petition until AFTER the approved H-1B effective start date, you are not eligible to have your F-1 SEVIS record returned to Active status. You may have a 60-day grace period during which to find alternative H-1B sponsors or apply for a change of status.
Advising on your options for H-1B portability, change of status, or adjustment of status is outside of the purview of OGS advisors. We recommend you consult an experienced immigration attorney to discuss these options.
Please review this additional information provided on the USCIS website regarding options following termination of H-1B employment.

If Your Cap-Subject H-1B Petition is Denied by USCIS:

Please refer to the guidance provided on the USCIS website.

If an H-1B petition filed for an F-1 student with a cap-gap extension is denied, rejected, revoked, or withdrawn, the student will have the standard 60-day grace period (from the date of the notification of the denial, rejection, revocation, or withdrawal of the petition) to depart the United States.
The 60-day grace period does not apply to an F-1 student whose accompanying change of status request is denied due to a status violation, misrepresentation, or fraud. In such cases, the F-1 student is ineligible for cap-gap extension of status and the 60-day grace period. Similarly, the 60-day grace period and cap-gap extension of status does not apply to an F-1 student whose petition was revoked based on a finding of a status violation, fraud or misrepresentation discovered following approval. In both of these instances, students are required to immediately leave the United States.

Frequently Asked Questions »

Frequently Asked Questions

×

Can OGS provide me with updates on the status of my H-1B petition?

Please note: OGS is unable to provide updates to students on the status of their H-1B petitions (SEVIS updates). If questions exist regarding this matter, please refer to your immigration attorney who has completed the H-1B petition on your behalf.
If you see an update to your OPT authorized dates in the SEVP Portal, this may mean there has been an update to your H-1B petition. If you notice your OPT end date has been extended to 9/30, please check with your attorney to confirm if you are subject to cap gap extension. OGS cannot confirm the status of your H-1B or provide a receipt number for your case.

Can OGS provide me with a letter concerning employment eligibility or data fixes?

OGS is unable to write letters to employers regarding eligibility to work or data fixes. We will be happy to forward the SEVP Policy Guidance regarding these issues. Department of Homeland Security regulations allow you to work if you are eligible for a cap gap extension of OPT, regardless of whether you have a cap gap I-20 or not. Whether your employer will allow you to work is at their discretion.

What happens if my H-1B is rejected/denied/withdrawn after applying for the cap gap extension?

If the student’s H-1B is not selected by the USCIS (rejected), the student will have the standard 60-day grace period* from the date of the rejection notice to depart the U.S., transfer the I-20 to a new program, or apply for a change of status. However, if a denial is based on a discovered status violation, no such grace period exists and the student must leave the U.S. immediately.
If the student’s H-1B petition is selected for processing but then subsequently denied or withdrawn, the student’s OPT ends 10 days after the date of denial/withdrawal. After this, the student will have the standard 60-day grace period*, unless the denial is due to a status violation (please see above).
*Students cannot work during the 60-day grace period.

If my H-1B processing is delayed and I do not receive my approval by October 1, can I extend my cap gap?

There is no extension for the cap gap extension of OPT. It ends on September 30, whether your H-1B is approved by then or is still pending. You will have to stop working on September 30 and wait for the H-1B approval.

What are my options if my H-1B employment is terminated?

Please review the information provided on the USCIS website. Advising on your options for H-1B portability, change of status, or adjustment of status is outside of the purview of OGS advisors. We recommend you consult an experienced immigration attorney to discuss these options.
It is important to note that, in most cases, once your status has changed to H-1B, OGS is no longer able to reactivate your F-1 SEVIS record. However, if you have an official withdrawal approval notice from USCIS confirming your H-1B petition was withdrawn by your employer prior to the H-1B effective date, OGS may be able to request that your SEVIS record be reactivated. In this case, you may contact OGS for assistance.
Academic Training Explained

Academic Training (AT) is employment authorization granted to eligible J-1 Students. It is designed to complement their programs of study in the United States.

AT is authorized by the program sponsor
Students may engage in AT during their academic program and/or after the completion of their studies
AT can be paid or unpaid, but must be authorized regardless of compensation
The work must be directly related to the student’s field of study
The work must be commensurate with their level of education
The work must be in a fully in-person or hybrid position (with no more than 40% remote)
The total amount of AT cannot exceed the total length of the academic program
AT authorization is location and date specific. The employer’s name and address and the employment dates must be authorized in advance by an Alternate Responsible Officer (ARO) in the Office of Global Services (OGS).

Pre-Completion vs. Post-Completion Academic Training

Pre-completion AT takes place before the J-1 Student completes all of their degree requirements. Post-Completion AT takes place after the J-1 student has completed all degree requirements.

Eligibility Requirements

A J-1 Student is eligible for Academic Training if they meet the following requirements:

Student has maintained valid J-1 status throughout their program
Student is in good academic standing or has successfully completed program of study
Student is proposing a training experience that is directly related to their field of study and has been approved by the academic advisor or Co-op coordinator
Student will not engage in a 100% remote academic training opportunity. Students may work remotely no more than 40% of the time (e.g., two days out of five in a standard work week) when their employers have instituted partial remote policies. Please see the June 2023 Department of State guidance directive for more information.
Student is maintaining health insurance coverage for themselves and any J-2 dependents

PLEASE NOTE: As Global Experience Office (GEO) incoming exchange programs at Northeastern do not currently include an internship experience, non-degree exchange students are not eligible to apply for Academic Training.

Time Limitations

J-1 Undergraduate and Master’s Degree students are eligible for up to 18 months of AT; this includes both pre- and post-completion AT

NOTE: through December 31, 2024, the Department of State is allowing extension up to 36 months (or length of degree program, whichever is shorter) for undergraduate and master’s degree level students in eligible STEM fields. Please contact OGS for more information.

J-1 Doctoral Degree students are eligible for up to 36 months of AT; this includes both pre- and post-completion AT
The total AT period may not exceed the amount of time spent in a full course of study

Example: A Master’s student who completed their program in 12 months is only eligible for 12 months of AT

Post-AT time begins the day after the program end date listed on your DS-2019, whether you are working or not.

Example: If your graduation date is 5/8/2019, you must start counting your post-AT time on 5/9/2019, even if you do not start working on that date

It is your responsibility to track your AT usage
Post-AT authorization must be processed before the graduation date on your DS-2019
Post-AT must begin within 30 days completion of your studies.

Please note: Both full and part-time AT deduct at a full-time rate. This means that, even if AT authorization is given for work done on a part-time basis, each day of part-time training deducts a full day from the total amount of time a student is eligible for AT.

Requesting Authorization

To participate in an off-campus experiential learning opportunity in the U.S., J-1 Students must obtain AT authorization from OGS. All students must comply with their college's requirements and policies concerning the timing of eligibility for Co-op or other experiential learning opportunity. Please note that individual academic departments or colleges may have additional requirements and regulations for eligibility. OGS will not review any requests for AT that have not already been reviewed by the appropriate advisor.

1

Meet with your academic or Co-op advisor to discuss your experiential learning opportunity.

OGS will not review any requests that have not been approved by your academic or Co-op advisor.

2

Complete the Academic Training Authorization Request with your academic or Co-op advisor.

The Academic Training Authorization Request Form can be found on the Office of Global Services website.

3

Upload the appropriate completed e-form with your advisor signature at the link provided on the first page of instructions.

Valid passport
I-94 showing J-1 class of admission and an admit until date of D/S
Original offer letter that shows the following:

company letterhead
employment start and end dates
hours worked per week
compensation

For post-completion AT only: if the salary is less than $2,334 per month, the student must submit additional financial documentation to meet the minimum funding requirements

4

Receive your DS-2019 with AT Authorization from an ARO in the Office of Global Services

OGS will review the student’s request to determine whether or not the student is eligible to participate in AT. If denied, the student will need to resubmit the e-form after making appropriate adjustments to their application. Authorized students will receive an email to their Northeastern University email address with their digitally-signed DS-2019 and AT authorization letter for Social Security Number eligibility attached.
PLEASE NOTE: approval from your academic or co-op advisor for an off-campus internship/co-op does NOT mean you are automatically authorized to work off-campus. You should not engage in any off-campus employment until you receive an authorization from OGS.

Important post-completion Academic Training reminders

Post-completion AT applications must be submitted at least 15 business days your completion of studies (DS-2019 program end date). After this date, the SEVIS record will become inactive and OGS will be unable to authorize AT.
Post-completion AT employment must begin within 30 days of your completion of studies (DS-2019 program end date).

Example: If a student’s graduation date is 5/8/2019, work on post-completion AT would need to start by 6/7/2019.

Reviewing your updated DS-2019

When receiving your electronic DS-2019 OGS, it is very important that you read your DS-2019 carefully to make sure you understand the limitations of your authorization. This will help prevent you from violating your status.
Please pay specific attention to the following areas:

Box 3 Form Covers Period – here you can see your new end date (if on post-completion AT)
Box 5 Academic Training – here you can see your employer information as well as the dates you are authorized to work

If there are any issues or concerns, please notify an Alternate Responsible Officer (ARO) in OGS.

Maintaining status while on Academic Training

While on AT, it is important you update OGS of any changes to your training. AT Authorization is employer, location, and date specific. Depending on the change, OGS may request additional documentation. It is important you do not engage in any changes until you have received your updated DS-2019 from OGS.
NOTE: OGS will not update your AT unless you have approval from the original advisor who signed off on your Academic Training Authorization Request.
100% remote work during academic training is not permitted per Department of State guidance. Students may work remotely no more than 40% of the time (e.g., two days out of five in a standard work week) when their employers have instituted partial remote policies.
IMPORTANT REMINDER REGARDING AT EXTENSIONS: If you are seeking an extension of your AT authorization, you may not request an extension via the update e-form. If you are extending your AT, you must submit the Academic Training Authorization Request.
For all other changes to AT, please submit the AT Updates Request.

Frequently Asked Questions »

Frequently Asked Questions

×

When do I need authorization?

This question is based off of what the U.S. government considers to be employment. Employment is considered work for compensation. Compensation can be monetary, but it can also be food, travel, lodging, or even beneficial experience. If you are benefiting from your participation in any way, you require authorization.
IMPORTANT: Just because an opportunity is unpaid does not mean it does not require authorization.

Do I need a valid visa to apply for Academic Training?

No. Visas are for entry purposes only. OGS does not require your visa to authorize AT.

How do I calculate how much money I will need for Post-Academic Training time?

Students are required to show a minimum of $2,334 per month when requesting or extending AT. In cases which require students to prorate how much money they need to show, the following breakdown may be helpful:

Per month – $2,334
Per week – $584
Per day – $84

What kind of financial documents can I submit if I'm applying for Post-Academic Training?

Financial documentation must meet the following criteria:

Be in English or a verified English translation
Show name of account holder. If the account holder is not the student, the account holder must submit a signed statement taking financial responsibility for the student.
Be issued within the past nine months
Be liquid (see below for examples of acceptable vs. unacceptable funds)

Acceptable forms of liquid funding:

Checking or savings account
Money market account
Certificates/term/fixed deposits (with maturity dates no later than the program start date)
Educational loans (a loan application is not sufficient)
Benevolent account
Current account
Post office account
Job offer letter

Unacceptable forms of funding:

Investment portfolios (stocks, bonds, mutual funds)
Retirement plans
Public Provident funds
Available lines of credit
Wire transfers
Deeds to real estate
Leases with rental income
Salary agreements or pay stubs

What is a Social Security Number?

A Social Security Number (SSN) is a 9-digit employee identification number issued by the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA). Eligibility for an SSN is based upon a person’s eligibility to work in the United States. Those eligible for a Social Security Number include U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and qualified foreign nationals — including, in certain circumstances, students in F-1 or J-1 student status and J-1 scholars. An SSN is required by the U.S. government in some cases for tax and employment reporting purposes.
A Social Security Number Card is an important identifying document. Please make sure you keep it in a safe place to avoid identity theft. Do not carry your card with you. Keep it in a safe place with your other important papers!
To learn more about what a Social Security Number is please visit the Social Security website.
Remember: Social Security Numbers are not valid forms of work authorization! Please read the employment section to learn about student and exchange visitor work authorization on and off campus.

When can I apply for a Social Security Number?

F-1 Students

The SSA recommends that you wait at least 10 business days after your SEVIS record is registered at the start of your program, so that your status is updated in all relevant government databases, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) database that the SSA checks as part of your application.
If you have Curricular Practical Training Authorization, you can apply 30 days before the start date of your Curricular Practical Training
If you have Optional Practical Training Authorization, you can apply after you have both your I-20 with Optional Practical Training endorsement and your Employment Authorization card
If you are working on campus, you can apply after you receive your On-Campus Employment Letter from the Office of Global Services, but no earlier than 30 days before the start date of your on-campus job.

J-1 Students

The SSA recommends that you wait at least 10 business days after your SEVIS record is validated at the start of your program, so that your status is updated in all relevant government databases, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) database that the SSA checks as part of your application.
If you have Academic Training Authorization, you can apply 30 days before the start date of your Academic Training
If you are working on-campus, you can apply after your receive your On-Campus Employment Letter from the Office of Global Services
Please note: J-1 sponsored students who are not under Northeastern University’s J-1 Exchange Visitor Program must seek permission from their Program Sponsor to work on or off-campus.

J-1 Scholars

The SSA recommends that you wait at least 10 business days after your SEVIS record is validated at the start of your program, so that your status is updated in all relevant government databases, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) database that the SSA checks as part of your application.
After this, if you are receiving a U.S. salary, you should apply for the SSN as soon as possible. If you are not receiving a U.S. salary, you’re not required to apply for an SSN but can do so at any time during your program after this 10 business day window.

What documents do I need?

Please note that X equals document is required.

Where do I apply?

After collecting all required documentation, you can apply for your Social Security Number with the Social Security Administration. The Social Security Administration has a few locations in the Boston area. When applying for your Social Security Number, you will need to go in person to one of the Social Security Administration locations.
Generally, there are three convenient locations for Northeastern students studying at the Boston campus:

Social Security Administration
10 Causeway Street
Boston, MA 02222
Social Security Administration
10 Fawcett Street
Cambridge, MA 02138
Social Security Administration
10 Malcolm X Blvd.
Roxbury, Ma 02119

For Northeastern students studying at the Seattle campus:

Social Security Administration
Suite 901
915 2nd Ave, Seattle, WA 98174

If you are not located in Boston or Seattle, you can find the nearest Social Security Office near you here.

How do I apply for a Social Security Number?

BOSTON CAMPUS ONLY
The Social Security Administration (SSA) no longer requires appointments in order to visit an office, and has reverted to the pre-pandemic process of accepting applicants on a walk-in basis.  This means you should no longer mail or fax in documents.
Additionally, the SSA has launched a new online portal: OSSNAP – Online Social Security Number Application Portal allows you to enter your personal information prior to your visit to the SSA, so that when you go to the office, the SSA representative will only need to verify your information and check your documents.
OGS strongly encourages students to complete the online application prior to visiting the SSA office in person.  It will save time and speed up the process for you.
Please note that the SSA is only able to process your SSN application up to 30 days prior to your employment start date.
How do I apply for a Social Security Number (SSN)?

First, you will need to gain proper documentation from OGS by obtaining one of the following documents:

An on-campus employment letter (if you have obtained an on-campus job)

F-1 On-Campus Employment Authorization Letter Request
J-1 On-Campus Employment Authorization Letter Request

A Stipended Graduate Assistantship (SGA) letter (if you have received an SGA from your department)

SGA Social Security Number Letter Request

An I-20 with CPT authorization on the second page (if you have a co-op/internship/etc.)

CPT Authorization Request

The SSA office will not be able to process your SSN application if you do not have the proper documentation from OGS.

Visit OSSNAP – Online Social Security Number Application Portal and start your SSN application by answering the questions online.
After completing the online application, note down the confirmation number. You must take the confirmation number and visit one of the SSA offices (ideally one closest to your residential address) within 45 days, but not more than 30 days before your employment start date.

Please keep in mind that masks are still required inside all SSA offices.
For all other campuses, please continue to contact your local SSA office to understand their process. We will continue to update our website as more information becomes available.

How long does it take to get a Social Security Number?

It takes about two to four weeks for an Social Security Number card to be issued. You are allowed to start working with just a letter/receipt from the Social Security Administration (SSA) stating you have applied for a Social Security Number. However, this is at the discretion of your employer. Typically, if an employer will be doing a background check they will only accept a Social Security Number before you can start working. Please talk with the Human Resources Department of your employer about their policy.
Remember! Social Security numbers are not valid forms of work authorization! Please read the employment section to learn about student and exchange visitor employment on and off campus.
If you receive a notice from the SSA stating that they cannot issue you an SSN because “the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is unable to verify the immigrant document you submitted as evidence of your lawful visa status,” please contact OGS for further assistance.

Complexities of volunteering

If you are interested in volunteering, you must be aware of relevant F-1 and J-1 regulations, so you and the organization do not violate any rules regarding employment authorization. F-1 and J-1 students who are working off-campus must be authorized before engaging in the employment. Without proper authorization, off-campus employment, including some volunteering, would be considered a violation of your F-1 or J-1 requirements. The consequences may include loss of your F-1 or J-1 status in the U.S.—making it difficult to reacquire lawful status within the U.S. If you are considering engaging in a volunteering opportunity, please make an appointment with an OGS adviser before making plans to begin any activity.

Volunteering vs. Unpaid Internship

There is a difference between volunteering and engaging in an unpaid internship.
Volunteering refers to donating time with an organization whose primary purpose is charitable or humanitarian in nature, without remuneration or any other type of compensation. F-1 and J-1 students are allowed to engage in volunteer work as long as it meets this stated criteria. For example, it is permitted for F-1 and J-1 students to volunteer at a local homeless shelter, charitable food pantry, or American Red Cross.
Unpaid internships, on the other hand, do not usually qualify as “volunteer” activity. Internships, both paid and unpaid, are primarily offered by the private sector and related to the intern’s major field of study. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students are advised to seek work authorization prior in order to engage in unpaid internships.
The Department of Labor in the U.S. has guidelines for those seeking an unpaid internship, please see here, the “Primary Beneficiary Test” outlined on the Department of Labor’s website can be used to determine whether or not the unpaid internship is considered employment.
Because of the consequences of unauthorized employment, we caution all F-1 and J-1 students to consult the Office of Global Services when considering engaging in an unpaid internship or volunteering opportunity. Please make an appointment with an OGS advisor before making plans to begin any activity.

U.S. Department of Labor's definition volunteering

The Department of Labor is concerned both with the protection of jobs for U.S citizens, and with the prevention of exploitation of workers. They have created laws to ensure employment that should be paid is not done for free. While both you and the employer may be happy with an unpaid arrangement (for example, you may be eager to work even on an unpaid basis in a company in order to gain job experience), this may be considered an unfair arrangement in cases where the work is normally performed by a paid person and both the company and the employee are benefiting from the employment.

How to determine whether an activity is truly volunteering and does NOT require work authorization

Employment authorization is NOT required when the work performed can be considered volunteering. To be considered volunteering, the work performed by the individual must meet the following criteria:

No compensation or expectation of compensation
The volunteer cannot displace a genuine employee and the services provided by the volunteer should not be the same services for which he or she was previously paid and/or expects to be hired and paid for in the future
Services are performed for a non-profit charity and the work is “charitable” in nature
Services are performed for a state or local government agency and there is a “civic” purpose to the work

Volunteering at Northeastern

If you are a student considering volunteering or engaging in unpaid internships at Northeastern or a staff/faculty looking to hire a volunteer or unpaid intern, please review this guidance from Northeastern University Office of General Counsel.
Due to the complexity of U.S. labor laws: all university departments, who want to have students volunteer within their department, are advised to thoroughly review this resource. If they have further questions on whether or not the engagement is considered volunteering, they should check directly with the Office of General Counsel.

Is it employment or volunteering?

A common misconception is that the only difference is employees get paid and volunteers do not. However, according to U.S. labor laws, there is more to distinguish between employees and volunteers than whether an individual receives a regular paycheck or not. Work that is unpaid may still be considered employment that requires F-1 or J-1 off-campus work authorization.

Who is considered an employee?

The definition of an employee used in the context of immigration regulations is as follows: “An individual who provides services or labor for an employer for wages or other remuneration.” The term “remuneration” is very broad and includes a variety of non-monetary benefits, such as free housing, food, gifts, etc.

Who is considered a volunteer?

According to the Department of Labor, volunteers are individuals “who volunteer or donate their services, usually on a part-time basis, for public services, religious or humanitarian objectives, not as employees and without contemplation of pay, are not considered employees of the religious, charitable or similar non-profit organizations that receive their service.” To learn more, click here.
Overview

J-2 dependents who enter the U.S. in J-2 status and are currently present in the U.S. are eligible to submit an application to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) in order to work in the U.S.
The processing time for EAD card applications varies, and can take up to 3 months. The application cannot be submitted until the J-2 dependent has entered the U.S. in J-2 status, and can only be submitted while the J-2 dependent is physically present in the U.S.
The EAD card will typically be issued to match the length of the J-1’s DS-2019. If the J-1 principal extends their DS-2019, and the J-2 would also like to extend their work authorization, they will need to submit a new I-765 application to USCIS to renew the EAD. J-2 dependents are only authorized to work during the dates authorized on their EAD card.
Both part-time and full-time work are permitted using a J-2 EAD card, however any income earned through J-2 employment should not be for the intention of supporting the J-1 principal. J-2 dependents are encouraged to include a support letter, written by themselves to USCIS, with their EAD application to clarify how prospective future employment will not be used for these purposes.

Required Documentation

To apply for an EAD, the J-2 dependent must prepare the following documents to mail to USCIS:

G-1145, e-Notification of Application/Petition Acceptance
Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization

On item #9, leave blank if you do not yet have a Social Security number. On item #16, put in the code, “(C)(5)( )”.

A check or money order payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (staple to I-765) .
NOTE: U.S. Department of Homeland Security fees are subject to change, please use the fee indicated on the Form I-765 page.
Letter explaining why work authorization is sought (see sample below), written by J-2 applicant; the letter should state that employment is not necessary to support the J-1
Photocopies of the J-2 and J-1’s current and prior DS-2019s
Two passport photos

Photos should be passport style: white background, unmounted glossy, with a full face position, not retouched
Photos should not be taken earlier than 30 days before submission to USCIS
Lightly print your name and SEVIS ID on the back of each photo with a pencil

Photocopy of the identification page in J-2’s passport
Photocopy of the visa page in J-2’s passport
J-2’s I-94
Photocopies of any Employment Authorization Document (EAD) cards previously issued to the J-2
Photocopy of the J-2’s driver’s license or other photo identification, if available
Marriage certificate (if spouse of the J-1), or birth certificate (if child of the J-1)

Foreign-language documents should include an official English translation

Mailing Instructions

Please be sure to mail your documents to the correct Lockbox address based on the mailing method you select.
For Overnight or Courier Delivery with tracking (RECOMMENDED), please use a service such as FedEx Next Day, UPS, etc. If using the United States Post Office (USPS) to mail your application, using “CERTIFIED Mail” is recommended.

Please note:

Expedited Appointments: if you make a J-1 visa visa appointment but the appointment date is after your DS-2019 program start date or does not give you sufficient time to arrive in the U.S. by the start date, please contact the U.S. Embassy/Consulate where you will be applying or check their website for their expedited appointment requirements. At many consulates, if you have a DS-2019 with a start date within 60 days and have already made a visa appointment, you may qualify for an expedited appointment.
J-1 Scholars must obtain their J-1 visa prior to traveling to the U.S. In anticipation of your visa appointment, please follow the J-1 visa application instructions specific to your local U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Requirements may differ among Embassy or Consulate locations.
Possession of a DS-2019 does not guarantee a J-1 visa.
Citizens of Canada or Bermuda are not required to obtain a J-1 visa stamp, but they must carry and present their J-1 documents, including the SEVIS fee receipt, when entering the U.S.

OGS strongly advises against purchasing flights or making other arrangements prior to receiving your J-1 visa. OGS will not expedite DS-2019 requests based on flights or living arrangements.

J-1 Transfers to Northeastern

If your J-1 SEVIS record is being transferred to Northeastern University, you do not need to pay the SEVIS fee again, if you have already paid it. If you are transferring from a U.S.-government sponsored Exchange Visitor program (indicated by a program code starting with “G,” such as G-1-0001) to Northeastern University, you are required to pay the I-901 SEVIS fee upon completion of the transfer process and before applying for a new J-1 visa.
If you are traveling internationally after your transfer to Northeastern is completed, you must plan to apply for a new J-1 visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad the next time you travel internationally.
Please note: you can remain in the U.S. with the J-1 visa stamp noting the previous institution as long as your new Northeastern DS-2019 remains valid. You do not need to depart the U.S. simply to renew the visa stamp unless you have a requirement to travel internationally. Please note that it is not possible to apply for a J-1 visa in the U.S.

Administrative Processing & Visa Denials

Administrative Processing & Visa Refusals
Although most J-1 visa applications are approved, the outcome of some J-1 visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as “Administrative Processing.” In these cases, the consular officer will convey to the applicant whether the applicant is required to provide any further documentation or information, or whether the case requires additional administrative processing. Please note that this is not a visa denial. Additionally, for J-1 scholars conducting research in certain STEM fields, your application may undergo additional security screening as part of administrative processing. This can often take several months and it is difficult to get updates from the Embassy during that time.
You should follow the instructions on the 221(g) to provide any requested information or documentation. If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, or if the 221(g) will delay your arrival to the U.S. to start your J-1 program, please contact [email protected].
Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing.
Visa Denials
Although J-1 visa denials are rare, the most common visa denial is under 214(b), which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non-immigrant intent, and/or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country (family, job, education, property) that indicate they will not immigrate to the U.S. and instead will return home after their J-1 program.
The J-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer’s questions, and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when a J-1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial.
If your J-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. You can apply again for the J-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial.
You can also review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa refusals and visa denials.
If you receive a visa denial that will prevent you from coming to the U.S. to begin or continue your J-1 program, please email your Northeastern HR contact & faculty supervisor, and copy [email protected] to notify us that you will not be starting your program.

Change of Status to J-1 Within The U.S.

Overview

This section includes information on how to apply for a change of status while remaining inside the U.S. If you are currently in the U.S. holding a visa type other than J-1, and are unable or choose not to change to J-1 status through traveling and applying for the J-1 visa abroad, you may choose to pursue change of status in the U.S. if otherwise eligible.
The more common method of gaining J-1 status (as outlined in the first sections of this page) is through traveling and re-entering the U.S. in your new J-1 visa status. In this case, you must apply for a J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate abroad. Applying at the local Embassy/Consulate in your home country is recommended. You can enter the U.S. no earlier than 30 days before the DS-2019 program start date. Depending on your situation, you may prefer to leave the U.S. to obtain the J-1 visa instead of proceeding with the change of status process in the U.S.
If you currently hold C, D, K, WB or WT status, you are not eligible to change to any other status within the U.S., including J-1. If you or your family are currently in J status (including J-2) and you are subject to the Two-Year Foreign Residency Requirement INA 212(e), you may not change status in the U.S. unless you have been granted a waiver.
USCIS processing times for adjudication of change of status applications to J-1 are 4-8 months depending on the processing center. We strongly recommend filing “premium processing” (which includes an additional $1,750 fee) to expedite the adjudication of your change of status application to ensure you can start your J-1 program on time.
PLEASE NOTE: The Office of Global Services (OGS) can provide general information regarding the process, requirements, and timeline for an I-539 change of status application, however, since this is your personal immigration application, we cannot assist with detailed question or assist you in filing the application. We recommend consulting with an experienced immigration attorney if you require assistance filing your application beyond the general information provided on this page.

DS-2019 Request Process

You will follow the same steps outlined in the first section on this page to confirm your appointment at Northeastern and initiate a DS-2019 request to OGS. Once you have received your DS-2019 from OGS, you may begin the process of submitting your change of status application to USCIS.

Required Documents

To request a change to J-1 status, you must submit the following documents to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS):

A completed USCIS Form I-539 (and Form I-539 Supplement if you have a spouse and/or dependents who will change to J-2 status). See here for filing instructions.
Filing fee of $370: You can pay the fee with a money order, personal check, cashier’s check, or pay by credit card using Form G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions. If you pay by check, you must make your check payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
OPTIONAL: Premium Processing – if you would like to pay an additional fee for premium processing to request that USCIS to provide a decision on your application within 15 days, you will need to submit the $1,750 I-907 premium processing fee.
Photocopy of SEVIS fee payment receipt.
Photocopy of the Form DS-2019 issued to you and all dependents, properly signed by you.
Photocopy of your and any dependent family members’ I-94 record from www.cbp.gov/i94.
Photocopy of information page of your passport (and of each dependent included in the application). Please note: Do not send your original passport.
Photocopy of the visa that you used to enter the United States.
If there are J-2 dependent applicants, you must submit evidence of their relationship to you (example: birth or marriage certificate with English translation).
You must provide evidence of residence abroad or other evidence proving ties to your home country.
Proof of financial support for any tuition and living expenses for the entire duration of your J-1 program for you and your dependents.

How to File Your Application

The filing location for your Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, depends on your filing classification and where you live.
You should use the filing address listed on the USCIS website in the “Nonimmigrants and Their Dependents” dropdown menu.
If you are requesting premium processing service for Form I-539, you must also file Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service, and review the “Where to File” section on that page.

After Applying for Change of Status

Once you have submitted your change of status application to USCIS, please email your receipt notice and approval notice once your petition is approved to [email protected].
Travel Considerations: You will abandon or cancel a pending change of status application by departing the U.S. while the petition is pending. Please also note that a change of status within the U.S. grants you J-1 status to remain in the U.S. and start/continue your J-1 program, however it does not grant you a J-1 visa stamp. If you travel internationally after approval of the J-1 change of status, you will need to apply for the J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate abroad in order to re-enter the U.S. to continue your J-1 program. Review the OGS website for visa application information and travel guidance.
Once your change of status is approved, follow the instructions in emails from OGS for viewing the J-1 scholar orientation and completing your researcher confirmation of arrival e-form.
If your plans change or you abandon your change of status application, please email [email protected].

Important Information

Maintaining Status: You must also maintain your current status while your change of status application is pending. Failure to do so may result in USCIS denying your change of status application. If a change of status application is not approved before the requested start date on your Form DS-2019, we must defer your start date to avoid SEVIS record cancellation. If the deferred start date is later than the expiration of your current nonimmigrant status, you may have to extend your current status; this is known as a “bridge” extension. We recommend that you consult an experienced immigration lawyer with questions about procedures and maintenance of status (including the need to file a bridge extension) during the pendency of a change of status application.
I-901 SEVIS Fee: All exchange visitors must pay a SEVIS (I-901) fee before applying for a J-1 visa or acquiring J-1 status. If you are a Canadian citizen exempt from the visa requirement, you must still pay this fee prior to submitting your change of status application. You will need Northeastern University’s Exchange Visitor Program Number to complete the Form I-901. The number is: P-1-03057. It is important that you have a receipt for the SEVIS fee payment before applying to change your status in the United States, as you will be required to submit this receipt with your change of status application. *For payment options or for details go to https://www.fmjfee.com/i901fee/index.html.
F-1 Visa Holders on Post-Completion or STEM Extension OPT: there are important considerations with the timing of your change from F-1 to J-1 in this circumstance. Please consult with OGS at [email protected] for advising.

Traveling and Travel Signatures

J-1 Scholars and their dependents must have a valid travel signature on their DS-2019 prior to traveling outside the United States. This signature is valid for one year or program duration of the DS-2019, whichever is earlier. It is your responsibility to submit a travel signature request prior to your first time traveling internationally, and to ensure it is valid or obtain additional signatures as needed for future travel.
If you travel outside the U.S., you will need:

Passport valid for at least six months into the future from the return date
J-1 visa valid past the return date
DS-2019 with a valid travel signature signed within the last year from the date of your return to the U.S.

If you need a new travel signature, please submit the J-1 Travel Signature Request e-form in myOGS. Please allow 10 business days for travel signature processing.
Once approved, you will receive a new digitally-signed DS-2019 for you (and any J-2 dependents on your record) with a valid travel signature to your Northeastern email address.

Automatic Revalidation

If you travel to Canada, Mexico, or certain Caribbean islands for less than 30 days, you may be eligible to re-enter the U.S. with an expired J-1 visa. Please refer to the Department of State website for more details prior to traveling.

Maintain Up-to-Date Immigration Documents

J-1 Scholars must have:

A passport that is valid at least six months into the future at all times, especially upon entry or re-entry to the U.S.

Passports must be renewed before they expire.
Passport renewals are done through the Embassy or Consulate of the country issuing the passport.

An accurate I-94 admission record

Class of Admission: J/1
Admit Until Date: D/S
Retrieve an updated I-94 every time you re-enter the U.S. during your program.
J-1 Scholars entering the U.S. by a land border should follow these I-94 application instructions.

The J-1 visa stamp does not need to be valid to maintain lawful presence in the U.S. However, J-1 Scholars must have a valid J-1 visa to enter the U.S. anytime they travel internationally.
OGS recommends keeping scanned and hard copies of all immigration documents.

Report Changes to Your Information

J-1 Scholars must report any changes to their address and/or U.S. phone number to OGS within 10 calendar days of the change by submitting a Contact Information Update e-form in their myOGS account (see the “Scholars and Researchers” section on your account main page).
If there are proposed changes to your Northeastern appointment title, site of activity, or changes in the source or amount of your funding, you must notify OGS in advance of these changes.

Maintain Active Health Insurance

Federal regulations require all J-1 Scholars and J-2 dependents to obtain health insurance for the duration of their program. J-1 Scholars who extend their program duration must ensure that their health insurance is extended to cover their stay. Please see Health Insurance Requirements for J-1 Scholars for more details. Please note that willful failure to have and maintain health insurance that meets the J-1 visa requirements may result in program termination.

Comply with Department of State Restrictions on Hybrid/Remote Work

Per Department of State Guidance Directive 2023-01 released on June 8, 2023, effective July 1, 2023, exchange visitors in the research scholar, professor, and short-term scholar categories must engage in their activities at Northeastern in-person, on-campus, a minimum of 60% of the time. This means that you may work remotely no more than 40% of your regular work hours (a maximum of 2 out of 5 regular work days per week).

Obtain Authorization for Incidental Employment

J-1 Scholars are only authorized to engage in the activity for which their DS-2019 has been issued. J-1 Scholars may be eligible to engage in additional, incidental employment if they request authorization from OGS in advance and if the requested activity meets certain eligibility requirements.
Occasional lectures and consultations
J-1 Scholars can engage in occasional lectures and consultations as long as the activity:

Is directly related to the J-1 Scholar’s program objective at Northeastern University.
Is incidental to the J-1 Scholar’s work at Northeastern University.
Does not interfere with the J-1 Scholar’s program completion date on the DS-2019.
Is approved and documented in SEVIS prior to its start date.

If the incidental employment pays an honorarium, stipend, or similar type of one-time payment, the J-1 Scholar must be paid as an independent contractor. J-1 Scholars cannot engage in incidental employment as salaried employees.
J-1 Scholars do not need to be paid as independent contractors if they will only be receiving a reimbursement for the authorized activity.
How to obtain incidental employment authorization
J-1 Scholars can request work authorization by submitting the Incidental Employment Authorization Request at least 10 business days prior to the anticipated employment start date. If you request is not approved by the employment start date, do not start working until you have received confirmation of authorization from OGS.
As part of the Incidental Employment Authorization Request, J-1 Scholars must submit support letters from both the faculty host at Northeastern and the institution where they will be engaging in incidental employment.
>> Sample letter for Northeastern faculty host
>> Sample letter for outside institution
J-1 Scholars approved for incidental employment will receive a confirmation letter and an updated DS-2019 if the incidental employment will provide additional funding.
Consequences of unauthorized employment
J-1 Scholars who engage in unauthorized employment are not able to obtain retroactive work authorization from OGS. Any work done without proper work authorization is considered unauthorized employment. Failure to request work authorization prior to the start of any incidental employment – paid or unpaid – may lead to the termination of your SEVIS record.
Failure to maintain J-1 status may be considered unlawful presence by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Out-of-Country for More Than 30 Days

The out-of-country functionality in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) allows J-1 Scholars to maintain an active record while outside of the U.S. for a scheduled period of time that exceeds 30 days. In order to be authorized for an absence of more than 30 days, J-1 Scholars must provide documentation showing that they will continue to engage in their program activities while they are away.
How to report out-of-country to OGS
J-1 Scholars can notify OGS of their plans to be outside of the U.S. for more than 30 days by submitting the Out of Country Request Form at least 10 business days prior to the anticipated departure date. OGS is not able to submit travel dates to SEVIS retroactively.
It is at OGS’ discretion whether or not to approve an out-of-country request. During the J-1 Scholar’s absence, Northeastern University continues to be the program sponsor. Therefore, J-1 Scholars must demonstrate that they will continue pursuing the program objective originally described in the appointment letter issued by the host college. As part of the Out-of-Country Authorization Request, the faculty host will have to provide a support letter attesting to the J-1 Scholar’s activities while outside of the U.S.
J-2 dependents must depart the U.S. with the J-1 Scholar for the duration of the out-of-country request.
J-1 Scholars are not required to request out-of-country authorization if:

They are vacationing outside the U.S. for 30 days or less with the permission of their department. Benefited employees are subject to Northeastern University’s paid time off policy.
The J-1 Scholar is an instructor and will be outside the U.S. during a term in which the department does not require them to teach, but will return in the following term to resume teaching.

J-1 Scholars who will be outside of the U.S. for more than 30 days and will not be engaging in their program activities may not be eligible to continue their program, in which case OGS will update the program end date in the SEVIS record to reflect the date of departure from the U.S. The updated program end date will determine the start of the 24-month bar and the 212(e) Two-Year Home Residency Requirement for applicable J-1 Scholars.
During their absence, J-1 Scholars must:

Maintain status and comply with the Exchange Visitor Program regulations.
Report any changes to the information submitted in the Out-of-Country Authorization Request.
Maintain both a permanent (foreign) address and current (U.S.) address and update them within 10 days after any changes.
Maintain a @northeastern.edu e-mail address.

During the J-1 Scholar’s absence, the host college must:

Continue supervising the J-1 Scholar while they are outside of the U.S.
Notify OGS of any changes to the information submitted in the Out-of-Country Authorization Request.

A valid travel signature is required on the DS-2019, in addition to a valid passport and J-1 visa, in order to return to the U.S.

Grace Period

All J-1 Scholars have a 30-day grace period following their program end date during which they have lawful presence in the United States. The grace period is not denoted on the DS-2019.
During the grace period, J-1 Scholars are only permitted domestic travel. International travel during the grace period will complete the existing J-1 record. J-1 Scholars who leave the U.S. during the grace period will not be granted re-entry to the U.S. with their existing J-1 visa and DS-2019, regardless of how much grace period time has passed.
Reminder: J-1 Scholars are not eligible to transfer to another institution during the grace period.

Transferring to Another Institution

J-1 Scholars may be eligible to transfer their SEVIS record to another institution from Northeastern if they meet that institution’s eligibility requirements. J-1 Scholars transferring out must submit the Transfer-Out Request Form at least 10 business days before the requested transfer-out date and no later than the program end date on the DS-2019. The HR Contact in the host college must submit the Transfer-Out SEVIS Contact Form in order for OGS to consider the request complete and ready for review.
J-1 Research Scholars/Professors are not eligible transfer to another institution if they have reached their five-year maximum program duration by the transfer-out date.

Required Minimum Funding

Please be aware that the minimum funding required per year is the following:

$28,000 for J-1 Scholar
$14,000 for spouse
$7,000 per child

The total financial support declared above should match or exceed the estimated living costs for the J-1 Scholar and their dependents, if applicable.
EXAMPLE:
A J-1 Scholar with a spouse and two children staying for one year would need to show $28,000 for themselves, $14,000 for the spouse, and $14,000 for the children: $56,000 in total.

Guidelines for acceptable proof of funds

Funding from sources other than Northeastern (private sponsor, government funding, scholarships, personal funds, etc.) will be considered towards meeting Northeastern’s minimum funding requirements, with the following restrictions:

All documentation must be officially translated into English and the translation must be certified; currency must be clearly referenced and converted into USD.
If you are providing a bank statement(s), it must include the following information:

official English translation
account holder’s name
currency
amount available
issue date (the bank statement cannot be older than 9 months upon receipt by OGS)

If you have multiple statements, upload all documents in this category together into one PDF and attach the coversheet.
Documentation must be copies of originals (please note that the U.S. Consulate requires original documentation during the visa application process).

Sponsorship by family member(s)

If the J-1 Scholar will be supported financially by a family member(s), please submit the following:

Financial institution documentation, such as bank statements or letters, including name of the financial sponsor; documentation must be recent, and not older than 9 months upon receipt by the Office of Global Services (OGS)
A letter signed by the financial sponsor attesting that the J-1 Scholar is entitled to the funds in the sponsor’s account

Sponsorship by home country organizations

In cases in which the documentation reflects a range in funding, OGS will use the lowest figure in the range, unless the J-1 Scholar provides a letter from the funding source indicating otherwise.
If a J-1 Scholar is sponsored by his/her home country employer (e.g., during a sabbatical from the home university), the letter from the employer must state that the J-1 Scholar will continue receiving a salary while at Northeastern (salary statement alone is not sufficient).
OGS retains the right to request original documentation or other means of clarification.
Failure to follow the instructions above will result in the delay of DS-2019 issuance.

Please note:

Expedited Appointments: if you make a J-1 visa visa appointment but the appointment date is after your DS-2019 program start date or does not give you sufficient time to arrive in the U.S. by the start date, please contact the U.S. Embassy/Consulate where you will be applying or check their website for their expedited appointment requirements. At many consulates, if you have a DS-2019 with a start date within 60 days and have already made a visa appointment, you may qualify for an expedited appointment.
J-1 Visiting Students must obtain their J-1 visa prior to traveling to the U.S. In anticipation of your visa appointment, please follow the J-1 visa application instructions specific to your local U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Requirements may differ among Embassy or Consulate locations.
Possession of a DS-2019 does not guarantee a J-1 visa.
Citizens of Canada or Bermuda are not required to obtain a J-1 visa stamp, but they must carry and present their J-1 documents, including the SEVIS fee receipt, when entering the U.S.

OGS strongly advises against purchasing flights or making other arrangements prior to receiving your J-1 visa. OGS will not expedite DS-2019 requests based on flights or living arrangements.

J-1 Transfers to Northeastern

If your J-1 SEVIS record is being transferred to Northeastern University, you do not need to pay the SEVIS fee again, if you have already paid it. If you are transferring from a U.S.-government sponsored Exchange Visitor program (indicated by a program code starting with “G,” such as G-1-0001) to Northeastern University, you are required to pay the I-901 SEVIS fee upon completion of the transfer process and before applying for a new J-1 visa.
If you are traveling internationally after your transfer to Northeastern is completed, you must plan to apply for a new J-1 visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad the next time you travel internationally.
Please note: you can remain in the U.S. with the J-1 visa stamp noting the previous institution as long as your new Northeastern DS-2019 remains valid. You do not need to depart the U.S. simply to renew the visa stamp unless you have a requirement to travel internationally. Please note that it is not possible to apply for a J-1 visa in the U.S.

Administrative Processing & Visa Denials

Administrative Processing & Visa Refusals
Although most J-1 visa applications are approved, the outcome of some J-1 visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as “Administrative Processing.” In these cases, the consular officer will convey to the applicant whether the applicant is required to provide any further documentation or information, or whether the case requires additional administrative processing. Please note that this is not a visa denial. Additionally, for J-1 scholars conducting research in certain STEM fields, your application may undergo additional security screening as part of administrative processing. This can often take several months and it is difficult to get updates from the Embassy during that time.
You should follow the instructions on the 221(g) to provide any requested information or documentation. If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, or if the 221(g) will delay your arrival to the U.S. to start your J-1 program, please contact [email protected].
Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing.
Visa Denials
Although J-1 visa denials are rare, the most common visa denial is under 214(b), which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non-immigrant intent, and/or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country (family, job, education, property) that indicate they will not immigrate to the U.S. and instead will return home after their J-1 program.
The J-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer’s questions, and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when a J-1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial.
If your J-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. You can apply again for the J-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial.
You can also review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa refusals and visa denials.
If you receive a visa denial that will prevent you from coming to the U.S. to begin or continue your J-1 program, please email your Northeastern HR contact & faculty supervisor, and copy [email protected] to notify us that you will not be starting your program.

OGS recommends keeping scanned and hard copies of all immigration documents.

Report Changes to Your Information

J-1 Visiting Students must report any changes to their address and/or U.S. phone number to OGS within 10 calendar days of the change by submitting a Contact Information Update e-form in their myOGS account (see the “Scholars and Researchers” section on your account main page).

J-1 Visiting Students who extend their program duration must ensure that their health insurance is extended to cover their stay. Please see Health Insurance Requirements for J-1 Visiting Students for more details. Please note that willful failure to have and maintain health insurance that meets the J-1 visa requirements may result in program termination.

Comply with Department of State Restrictions on Hybrid/Remote Work

Required Minimum Funding

Please be aware that the minimum funding required per year is the following:

$28,000 for J-1 Visiting Student
$14,000 for spouse
$7,000 per child

The total financial support declared above should match or exceed the estimated living costs of the J-1 Visiting Student and their dependents, if applicable.
IMPORTANT: J-1 Visiting Students can only use personal or family funds for up to 50% of the required minimum funding. This means that more than 50% of the required funding needs to come from Northeastern University, their home institution, or another funding source.
EXAMPLE:
A J-1 Visiting Student with a spouse and two children staying for one year would need to show $28,000 for themselves, $14,000 for the spouse, and $14,000 for the children: $56,000 in total.
A J-1 Visiting Student would only be able to show half of $56,000, or $28,000, in personal or family funds. They would also need to provide at least $28,000 from Northeastern, their home institution, or another funding source.

Guidelines for acceptable proof of funds

Funding from sources other than Northeastern (private sponsor, government funding, scholarships, personal funds, etc.) will be considered towards meeting Northeastern’s minimum funding requirements, with the following restrictions:

All documentation must be officially translated into English and the translation must be certified; currency must be clearly referenced and converted into USD.
If you are providing a bank statement(s), it must include the following information:

official English translation
account holder’s name
currency
amount available
issue date (the bank statement cannot be older than 9 months upon receipt by OGS)

If you have multiple statements, upload all documents in this category together into one PDF and attach the coversheet.
Documentation must be copies of originals (please note that the U.S. Consulate requires original documentation during the visa application process).

Sponsorship by family member(s)

If the J-1 Visiting Student will be supported financially by a family member(s), please submit the following:

Financial institution documentation, such as bank statements or letters, including name of the financial sponsor; documentation must be recent, and not older than 9 months upon receipt by the Office of Global Services (OGS)
A letter signed by the financial sponsor attesting that the J-1 Visiting Student is entitled to the funds in the sponsor’s account

Sponsorship by home country organizations

In cases in which the documentation reflects a range in funding, OGS will use the lowest figure in the range, unless the J-1 Visiting Student provides a letter from the funding source indicating otherwise.
If J-1 Visiting Student is sponsored by his/her home country employer (e.g., during a sabbatical from the home university), the letter from the employer must state that the J-1 Visiting Student will continue receiving a salary while at Northeastern University (salary statement alone is not sufficient).
OGS retains the right to request original documentation or other means of clarification.
Failure to follow the instructions above will result in the delay of DS-2019 issuance.

ABOUT THE PROGRAM

The mission of the Office of Global Services’ Global Student Mentor Program is to:

Support incoming international students as they transition to college life at Northeastern and American culture
Foster engagement with the Northeastern community
Improve resource awareness and utilization

A peer mentor is a current student who spends time with new students to help them adjust to college life. Both international and domestic students can apply to be peer mentors. The students who receive mentorship are called “mentees.”

Participating new students will be matched with an OGS Global Student Mentor. The mentor will reach out first via Qooper to introduce themselves and set up the first meeting. Throughout the academic term, mentees will connect with their mentor in person through 1-1 meetings, small group sessions, and group gatherings. 1-1 and small group meetings take place in-person at least once per month. Mentees can ask questions and receive advice from the perspective of an experienced Northeastern student. Mentors will help their mentees set goals and make steps toward completing these goals throughout the first semester at Northeastern. Mentees might consider discussing with their mentors:

How to access resources on campus
How to join a club or get involved with the campus community
Suggestions for developing college-level study skills
How to use public transportation in Boston
Questions about American culture
Feelings of homesickness

Within the GSM Program, students will have the opportunity to build community in various forms:

Small Group Sessions
At least 2 GSM Meetups per semester
Affinity Groups
Mentee Resource Groups

Small Group sessions are led by a Global Student Mentor and are designed to introduce parts of the curriculum while providing a more intentional space for community development.
GSM Meetups are a great opportunity to meet people from all over the world with a shared experience- a first semester graduate student at Northeastern.
Affinity groups are identity based groups designed to connect students to campus resources for long term support and resources.  The GSM Program only supports students in their first semester, so this is a great way to get connected to the broader campus community.  Currently, the Affinity Groups include:

First Generation
Women
LatinX

Mentee Resource Groups are groups designed to connect mentees based on their shared interests.  We currently offer five MRGs including:

Health and Wellness
Travel and Explore
Skills and Budgeting
Career and Learning
Hobbies and Interests

It is important that mentees make the same level of commitment as their mentor. This includes being responsive to your mentor and making time in your schedule for regular meetings throughout the whole semester.
Northeastern has many different mentorship programs, so please review other options to find which program best supports your interest and needs. The OGS program is dedicated to supporting international students in their cultural transition and academic success. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that your mentor will be a student in your same academic program. If you are interested in peer support specific to your academic program, please consult with your academic advisor to see what may be available. Although there are resources for career or workplace networking, this is not the goal of this program.

Important disclaimer

The information on the Office of Global Services webpage is provided as guidance and is not intended to be legal tax advice. The Office of Global Services staff are not tax specialists and are NOT qualified to answer international students/scholars questions regarding taxes. If you believe you have a complicated tax issue, please consult the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, federal and state tax agencies, and tax professionals for advice and guidance regarding your individual tax situations.
The Office of Global Services has arranged access to Sprintax for you. Sprintax will guide you through the tax preparation process, arrange the necessary documents and check if you’re due a tax refund.
The code can be used for Federal taxes. If you have a state filing requirement, this will not be covered by the code and you must also mail this to the tax authorities. You are not required to use Sprintax and can use a different tax preparation software (or complete it on your own) if you prefer.
OGS also encourages students to utilize resources on Sprintax’s blog. You can use the search bar to seek information about the most frequently asked tax-related questions!

Sprintax Code

The Office of Global Services is providing Northeastern students with a unique code to cover the costs of filing a federal tax return and Form 8843 through Sprintax. These codes are limited and available on a first-come first-serve basis, so don’t put off your taxes to the last minute! The code was emailed out to all current students the first week of February – please check your junk/clutter folders in your email inbox if you do not remember receiving it. If you still cannot find it, please contact OGS through the OGS Service Portal and we will re-send it.

Understanding taxes

If you receive U.S. source income, including wages, stipend, or scholarship, you will likely have federal and state tax withheld from your checks.
U.S. taxes is a pay-as-you go system in that there may be automatic tax withholdings from your paycheck, stipend, or financial aid. This means that in some instances your available income will be reduced by the tax withholdings. When you file your annual tax report in April of each year, you will calculate the exact amount of tax due. (Some years you may get a refund and in others you may owe additional taxes.)

Who must file tax forms for 2024 tax season?
Even if you did not earn any income, if you were physically in the US on F or J status anytime between January 1st – December 31st 2023, you’re obligated to file a Form 8843 with the IRS (the Internal Revenue Service, or ‘IRS’, are the US tax authorities).
Meanwhile, if you earned any taxable US source income, you may need to file a federal tax return with the IRS. Depending on your individual circumstances, you may also need to file a state tax return(s).
Tax Filing Deadline:
April 15, 2024 is the last day for residents and nonresidents who earned US income to file Federal tax returns for the 2023 tax year.
Who is considered Resident or Nonresident for Federal Tax Purposes:
Generally, most international students & scholars who are on F, J, M or Q visas are considered nonresidents for tax purposes. International students on J-1 & F-1 visas are automatically considered nonresident for their first five calendar years in the US, whilst Scholars/Researchers on J visas are automatically considered nonresidents for two out of the last six calendar years in the US.
If you’ve been in the US for longer than the five or two year periods, the Substantial Presence Test will determine your tax residency.

Step by Step guide on How to File Your Nonresident Tax Forms (F and J)
1)  Gather the documents you may need for Sprintax

Document
Description

Passport

Visa/Immigration information, including
form I-20 (F status) or form DS-2019 (J status)

Social Security or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (if you have one)
This is not needed if you had no income and the 8843   is the only form you have to file.

W-2
This form reports your wage earnings if you worked.
If you had more than one employer you should get a W-2 from each employer. It is issued by the  end of January for the previous year. Make sure all employers from last year have an up-to-date  address for you.

1042-S
This form is used to report:

1.  Stipend, scholarship, fellowship income and travel grants (not tuition reduction or exemption)
2.  Income covered by a tax treaty
3.  Payment for other types of services (eg by the  semester as a note-taker)
If you received this type of income, the 1042-S will be e mailed to you by 15 March by the payer.
Note: Only Nonresident Aliens receive this form. If your tax status changes to a Resident Alien you will not get a 1042-S. Login to Sprintax to check your tax status if you’re not sure.

US entry and exit dates for current and past visits to the US
In addition to passport stamps, you can review or print your US travel history here

1099
This form reports miscellaneous income. Can be interest on bank accounts, stocks, bonds, dividends, earning through freelance employment

1098-T
This form is NOT needed and can NOT be used for a nonresident tax return because NRAs are not eligible  to claim education expense tax credits.

2)   Follow the Sprintax instructions
If you did not earn any US Income: Sprintax will generate a completed Form 8843 for you and each of your dependents (if you have any).
If you did earn US Income: Sprintax will generate your “tax return documents”, including form 1040NR, depending on your circumstances.
3)   If required, complete your state tax return
After you finish your federal return, Sprintax will inform you if you need to complete a state tax return. If so, you will have the option to use Sprintax for an additional fee. However, it is your choice to use them or to do the state tax return on your own.
4)   Read the instructions for filing/mailing your returns
Remember to read the instructions that Sprintax provides.
You will be required to download, print and sign your federal tax return and mail it  to the IRS. Depending on your circumstances, you may be able to E-file your Federal tax return. However, this will depend on certain eligibility criteria. You can learn more about eligibility in this Sprintax blog – https://blog.sprintax.com/nonresident-federal-tax-efiling-live/
If you have a state filing requirement, you must also mail this to the tax authorities.
Finally, if you only need to file Form 8843, this will also need to be mailed to the IRS.
DISCLAIMER: The Office of Global Services and Northeastern are NOT permitted to assist any student/scholar with any IRS tax form preparation or tax related questions. The information provided is intended for your benefit. Any questions or concerns should be directed to Sprintax, a certified tax preparer or a local IRS field office.

State and local tax

Some students and scholars must also file a state and/or municipal (local) tax form. For more information, please refer to the respective State Department of Revenue (e.g. Massachusetts Department of Revenue FAQ site)
Sprintax will help determine your State residence status. If you used the software to prepare your federal tax return it will prepare the forms you will need to file, if it is required
NOTE: You may be required to file a state tax return for each state you lived or worked during the preceding calendar year.

Do I need to file taxes?

YES! You must file federal tax returns if you were in the U.S. for any period of time during the previous calendar year.
If you receive income in the U.S., including wages, stipend, or scholarship funds, you will likely have federal and state tax withheld from your checks.

Safety

Boston is a safe city although there is occasional crime, as in all populated areas. Please check with the Northeastern University Police Department for special concerns or questions.
Northeastern University Police Department numbers

NON-EMERGENCY: 617-373-2121
EMERGENCY: 617-373-3333

Northeastern has NU ALERT, a service that allows the administration to reach all students and staff with time-sensitive information during unforeseen events or emergencies. The system uses voice, e-mail, and text messaging to broadcast pertinent information and, when appropriate, provide directions. Your myNortheastern information is your link to NU ALERT, so please keep your information up-to-date.
General safety tips for walking and exercising:

Avoid walking or jogging alone (especially at night)
Use well-lit, familiar streets. (Never take poorly lit shortcuts through alleyways or wooded areas)
Be aware of your surroundings
Avoid using cell phones or listening to music with headphones. (Plan your route and walk confidently)

Northeastern’s Public Safety Division provides an on-campus personal safety escort service twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Call the Northeastern University Police Department at 617-373-2121 and give them your name, Northeastern identification number, and location.
Public Safety also provides an off-campus shuttle, the Red-Eye, when you leave campus to return to your off-campus apartment from 7:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. This university-operated hourly shuttle departs from the Snell Library on the hour, starting at 7:00 p.m. The shuttle is free and provides service to student residences in a one-and-a-half-mile radius of campus.

Scams

If you have been a victim of a scam of any kind please contact NUPD imminently: 617-373-2121!
You can find a list of the most common immigration scams on the USCIS website.
Scam alert – imposter calls!
If someone claiming to be a government official or law enforcement officer calls making threats such as deportation, beware! Hang up and report it!
Here’s how it works
A number appears on your caller identification that may look like a legitimate government number. When you answer, the person on the phone poses as a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services or other government official or law enforcement officer. The scammer (or scammers) will say there is a problem with your application or additional information is required to continue the immigration process. Then, they will often ask for sensitive personal and financial information, demand payment, and threaten you with deportation, arrest, or other negative consequences if you do not comply.
The scammer will then order victims to make a payment – and will often order them to go to a nearby bank or store and withdraw money or purchase a prepaid card, gift card, voucher, money order or make some other wire transfer, money exchange, payment or withdrawal. (Note that the scammers are often able to direct victims to nearby banks or stores by using online maps to study the area in which a victim resides.)
If you receive a call like that, hang up immediately. We will never ask for any form of payment over the phone or in an email. If we need payment, we will mail a letter on official stationery requesting payment. Do not give payment over the phone to anyone who claims to be a USA Citizenship and Immigration Services official. In general, we encourage you to protect your personal information and not to provide details about your immigration application in any public area.
Steps you can take
Please report any suspicious call or e-mail to the Office of Global Services.
If you have been a victim of this telephone or email scam, please report it to the Federal Trade Commission. If you receive a suspicious email or voice message and are not sure if it is a scam, forward it to the the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services webmaster at ([email protected]). They will review the messages received and share with law enforcement agencies as appropriate. Visit the Avoid Scams Initiative for more information on common scams and other important tips.
If you have a question about your immigration record, please call the National Customer Service Center at 800-375-5283 or visit https://my.uscis.gov/appointment to make an InfoPass appointment. You can also use myUSCIS to find up-to-date information about your application process.

Health at Northeastern University

This health care section presents information for Northeastern students and scholars at the Boston campus. Students in Seattle should refer to the Health Resources section of the Seattle campus website. Students in Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area should refer to the Health Resources section of the Silicon Valley campus website.

Student Health Care

To assure students in Massachusetts have access to health care and are protected against the potentially significant financial impact of an unexpected illness or accident, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts mandates all students participating in at least 75% of a full-time course load in a degree-seeking program must participate in their school’s student health plan or in a health benefit program with comparable coverage that meets Qualifying Student Health Insurance Program standards.
In accordance with Massachusetts regulations, you will automatically be enrolled in Northeastern University’s health benefits program, NUSHP, each academic year. The cost of coverage will be included in your bill. You have the option to waive this coverage, but only if you provide proof that you are covered by a plan with comparable health benefits that also meets Massachusetts’s regulations.
The NUSHP healthcare program offers comprehensive benefits to students wherever they travel, work, or study. The NUSHP web pages explain the process for using the health care center and for emergency needs. Students with other health programs will receive a guide to services from those programs.
Students studying in the U.S. may not waive insurance based on coverage through insurance carriers owned and operated outside the U.S. nor by coverage through foreign National Health Service programs. Students sponsored by foreign embassies, agencies, and organizations are not excluded from the requirement for U.S.-based health insurance.

University Health Report

Massachusetts law requires all University students to provide documentation of vaccination against Hepatitis B, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Meningitis, Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis and Varicella. Please see the University Health and Counseling Services (UHCS) page for details on how to return the report and the deadlines.

J-1 Visa Holders

In compliance with federal regulations, the U.S. Department of State requires J-1 exchange visitors and their J-2 dependents to have a health insurance policy that meets or exceeds these benefits:

Medical benefits of at least $100,000 per accident or illness
In case of death, repatriation of remains in the amount of $25,000
Expenses in the amount of $50,000 associated with the medical evacuation of the J exchange visitor to his or her home country
A deductible amount not to exceed $500 per accident or illness

J-1 scholars sponsored by Northeastern University should be aware that Northeastern health plans do not include insurance for evacuation and repatriation of remains. Scholars eligible for and selecting a Northeastern plan must purchase separate evacuation and repatriation insurance.

Living on- and off-campus

Northeastern University Housing and Residential Life provides in-depth information for on-campus and off-campus housing.
Upper class students, graduate students, and scholars interested in off-campus housing will find that rent will be your greatest expense when living in Boston (apart from tuition). Many students live with roommates and choose to use the T (subway) to get to/from Northeastern. Off Campus Housing and Support Services is here to help guide you through the process of finding housing.
Review the ‘International Student’ page, ‘Get Started’ page, watch their off-campus video series, and download their International Student Apartment Guide. Wait until you arrive in Boston to secure an apartment and make payments. Read more about avoiding scams here. Arrive early to give yourself time to find an apartment. Secure temporary housing from your home country so you have a place to stay when you arrive and while you look for housing.
Please see here for housing in Seattle.

U.S. Government Agencies

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is the U.S. umbrella agency for maintaining national security.

Department of Homeland Security administers U.S. immigration policy through Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which manages the Student and Exchange Visitor Program

The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System is the web-based program the Department of Homeland Security designed to track international student and scholar flows and status, managed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement

U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, another branch of the Department of Homeland Security, concerns itself with the benefits of immigration, including regulations for international students and scholars to work in the U.S.

Customs and Border Protection reviews documents when international students and scholars arrive in the U.S.. (You can print your electronic I-94 form at the Customs and Border Protection site)

through the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, which strives to promote mutual understanding between the people of the U.S. and people around the world through information to potential international students (EducationUSA) and designation of exchange programs like Fulbright

The Internal Revenue Service is the U.S. tax collection agency. Please see information for Current Students. The Social Security Administration issues Social Security Numbers and cards as described in the Employment Resources page.

Jury Duty

While living in the U.S., you may receive a “jury summons” requesting that you serve on a jury. As an international student you are not eligible to perform jury duty, but you still must take action to respond to the request to demonstrate your ineligibility.
In order to serve on a jury in the U.S., you must meet ALL of the following criteria:

Be a citizen of the United States
Be 18 or older
Be a resident of or live in your specific state in the U.S. for more than 50% of the year
Speak and understand English well enough to be able to participate in a trial

As an international student, you are not a U.S. Citizen, so you are not eligible to serve.
Massachusetts Campus Students:
More information on eligibility to serve on a jury is available here.
If you receive a jury summons, you must respond to the Jury Service notice that you received in the mail to notify that you are disqualified from serving. On Mass.gov website, instructions on how to respond to your jury summons online is available here: https://www.mass.gov/how-to/respond-to-your-jury-summonshttps://www.mass.gov/how-to/respond-to-your-jury-summons
Other U.S. Campuses:
Carefully review the jury summons document for instructions to report your ineligibility for jury duty.

Scam alert – imposter calls!

If someone claiming to be a government official or law enforcement officer calls making threats such as deportation, beware! Hang up and report it!
Here’s how it works
A number appears on your caller identification that may look like a legitimate government number. When you answer, the person on the phone poses as a USA Citizenship and Immigration Services or other government official or law enforcement officer. The scammer (or scammers) will say there is a problem with your application or additional information is required to continue the immigration process. Then, they will often ask for sensitive personal and financial information, demand payment, and threaten you with deportation, arrest, or other negative consequences if you do not comply.
The scammer will then order victims to make a payment – and will often order them to go to a nearby bank or store and withdraw money or purchase a prepaid card, gift card, voucher, money order or make some other wire transfer, money exchange, payment or withdrawal. (Note that the scammers are often able to direct victims to nearby banks or stores by using online maps to study the area in which a victim resides.)
If you receive a call like that, hang up immediately. We will never ask for any form of payment over the phone or in an email. If we need payment, we will mail a letter on official stationery requesting payment. Do not give payment over the phone to anyone who claims to be a USA Citizenship and Immigration Services official. In general, we encourage you to protect your personal information and not to provide details about your immigration application in any public area.
Steps you can take
If you have been a victim of this telephone or email scam, please report it to the Federal Trade Commission. If you receive a suspicious email or voice message and are not sure if it is a scam, forward it to the the USA Citizenship and Immigration Services webmaster at ([email protected]). We will review the messages received and share with law enforcement agencies as appropriate. Visit the Avoid Scams Initiative for more information on common scams and other important tips.
If you have a question about your immigration record, please call the National Customer Service Center at 800-375-5283 or visit https://my.uscis.gov/appointment to make an InfoPass appointment. You can also use myUSCIS to find up-to-date information about your application process.
Please report any suspicious call or e-mail to the Office of Global Services.
Northeastern Police Department has posed a video about scams, please make sure to view it here.

Proof of Acceptance (POA)
Students who need Northeastern University’s assistance with their study permit application will be able to download their Proof of Acceptance (POA) document from the application portal.
POA letters are automatically generated in the application portal once all the steps required for admission are completed, and you confirm you will be studying at a NU Canadian campus. The POA will not be issued until the final review of your application documents has been completed. The process of final review takes place after you have confirmed your offer of admission and may take up to 10 days to complete. Usually, you receive your POA 6-8 months prior to the start of your program.
OGS Canada DOES NOT issue POAs.
The POA contains information you have provided in your application to Northeastern University. If there is an error, such as your name is misspelled, or your date of birth is incorrect, then please connect back to your Admissions team to correct this information using their information below:
CPS: For questions about CPS admissions, please check their support centre here: https://northeastern.my.site.com/GraduateAdmissionsFAQ/s/
If you are unable to find your answer in the knowledge base, you can submit an inquiry form from your application portal – check your portal for a box with the title Submit an Inquiry/Submit a Request. To login to your portal click here: http://enroll.northeastern.edu/apply/status
COE: [email protected]
COS: [email protected]
Khoury: [email protected]
CAMD: gradcamd@northeastern.edu
You should receive your POA 6-8 months prior to the start of your program. If you have not received a POA and it is at least 4 months until you start your program, please submit an inquiry form to OGS Canada here. Please allow 5-8 business days for a response during peak times, and only send one email to avoid duplication, which slows down response time. Be sure to include your full name and NU Student ID, and send it from your NU student email address so we can locate your record and provide accurate information.
Payment (Deposit or first-year tuition for SDS)
During enrolment confirmation, international students from one of the SDS eligible countries will have the option to indicate how they would like to apply for their study permit processing, e.g. SDS/non-SDS.
If you are eligible for SDS and wish to pay for the first-year tuition to support your study permit application, you need to indicate you will be applying through SDS otherwise you won’t receive the first-year tuition invoice.
If you are not eligible for SDS or if you have indicated you will not be applying through SDS, you will receive a deposit invoice for $500 CAD.
If you have questions about invoice and payment, please submit an inquiry to Student Accounts Canada here.
Please note: The Study Permit is not a visa, and does not, by itself, allow you to travel to or enter Canada. You may also need a visitor visa or an electronic travel authorization. More information about this process will be mailed with your POA and is available on the Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) website.

Deposit and SDS Refund Policies

Frequently Asked Questions

What is a Study Permit?

A Study Permit is the immigration document issued by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) that provides permission for an international student to study in Canada. This permit is your status document while you are studying in Canada and you must make sure to meet the requirements of your study permit. See here for more information about the conditions under a study permit.
It is your responsibility to ensure that your Study Permit is valid for the duration of your academic program in Canada.
If you are from a country that requires an entry visa (TRV) OR an eTA, this will be issued for you upon approval of your study permit – you do not make a separate application for a travel visa. On approval, you will be given a visa or eTA and a letter of introduction to travel to Canada and you will be issued your study permit upon arriving at the Port of Entry in Canada.
When to Apply
The Study Permit application process can be lengthy. It is very important you apply for the permit as soon as you receive the Proof of Acceptance letter. We recommend applying a minimum of 3-4 months before your program start date. Be sure to check with IRCC to determine the estimated processing time based on your country of application.
Proof of Acceptance (POA)
You will need your Proof of Acceptance letter (POA) (also called Letter of Acceptance) to submit with your Study Permit application. The POA will be available to download on your application portal, where you will also find your Admission Letter. Please note that OGS Canada does not issue POAs under normal circumstances. POAs are generated automatically in your portal and should become available to you 6-8 months before your program start date.
Confirming Enrollment Decision
Once you claim your NU account, use your Northeastern credentials to login to the applicant’s portal using the link provided in your acceptance package.
Payment (Deposit or first-year tuition for SDS)
During enrolment confirmation, international students (from one of the 14 SDS countries) will have the option to indicate how they would like to apply for their study permit processing, e.g. SDS or Non-SDS.
After confirming enrolment, you should receive an email in 5-10 business days (to both the registered email account and the NU Student email) from Student Accounts Canada with payment instructions.
International students applying for a study permit through the non-SDS process are not required to pay the first-year tuition in advance. They will receive a deposit invoice for $500 CAD.
International students applying for a study permit through the Student Direct Stream (SDS) process will receive an invoice which will include the estimated first year tuition fee.
Payments can be made via wire transfer or credit card, and must be initiated online through your payment portal.
After you make the payment using the payment portal, you will be issued a receipt within two weeks, depending on your method of payment, to attach to your study permit application. The confirmation email will be sent from the Student Accounts Canada team. All payments are due 30 days from the invoice issue date.
For further information about payments, please see here or reach out to Student Accounts Canada here for questions.

Apply for your Study Permit

Students may apply for their Study Permit via an online application portal or via paper application. You also have the option of using the services of an authorized third party application collection service, called a Visa Application Centre (VAC). If you are able, apply using the online application portal, as generally, online applications are processed more quickly than paper applications. Estimated processing times per country are available on the IRCC site.
All the information you need for the Study Permit application process is available on the IRCC website. This process is not managed by Northeastern University and we do not have additional insight into processing times or delays.
If you choose to use the services of an immigration advisor or lawyer to assist you with your application, please be certain to choose someone who is legally permitted to represent you to IRCC. To determine if a person is an authorized representative, please read the guidelines here.
Documents Required for Initial Study Permit
Please visit the official IRCC website for the complete details.
Please make sure to also read the visa office specific guidelines for your country of nationality.

New Policy Updates – December 2023
As a reminder, starting January 1, 2024, the cost-of-living financial requirement for study permit applicants will be raised so that international students are financially prepared for life in Canada. Moving forward, this threshold will be adjusted each year when Statistics Canada updates the low-income cut-off (LICO). LICO represents the minimum income necessary to ensure that an individual does not have to spend a greater than average portion of income on necessities.
For 2024, a single applicant will need to show they have $20,635, representing 75% of LICO, in addition to their first year of tuition and travel costs. This change will apply to new study permit applications received on or after January 1, 2024.
Please monitor IRCC webpage for detailed updates of the proof of financial support for study permit applications.

Next Steps

If your application is approved, the visa office serving your country of residence/citizenship will issue you a Letter of Introduction. Please read through your Letter of Introduction/Port of Entry letter (POE) closely and carefully. Further instructions related to requirements for a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV), Entry Visa, or eTA will be included in this letter. Please note that it is imperative that you take any next steps outlined in your Letter of Introduction (POE) in a timely manner. Do not book your travel arrangements to Canada until you’ve received your Letter of Introduction.

Co-op or Internship Work Permit

You may also apply for a co-op permit when you apply for your study with your initial study permit.

You may upload your POA document as your “School Letter” to the IRCC portal as proof that Co-Op is part of your program. You may be given a Co-op work permit at the border with your Study Permit.

For more information about co-op permits and work during your co-op see the Co-op Permit page.

Student Direct Stream

Please read this section if you are applying from an SDS eligible country.

Depending on your country of citizenship AND country of residence, you may be eligible for the Student Direct Stream processing, which provides expedited processing, usually in 3-4 weeks. To qualify to use the Student Direct Stream, the student should be a citizen and residing in one of the following countries:

Antigua and Barbuda
Brazil
China
Colombia
Costa Rica
India
Morocco
Pakistan
Peru
Philippines
Senegal
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
Trinidad and Tobago
Vietnam

Student must pay upfront one year of tuition in order to show IRCC a copy of the receipt and purchase an investment certificate to cover living expenses for their first year of living expenses (the actual cost of living varies greatly depending on accommodation and other variable expenses, so the required GIC may not be sufficient for all your living expenses).
To learn more about the Student Direct Stream, please visit the IRCC website.
To be eligible, applicants must meet specific requirements by providing documentation up front. Please check the Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) website for more information and instructions.
The amount billed on the SDS payments is an estimate of fees for the year. Exact tuition rates are updated every year. You are responsible for checking the amount per credit hour for your program. Depending on your program and the number of courses you take, you may end up owing more or less for the year. If you have paid more than the amount owed for the year, it will sit in your account as a credit; if you have paid less, you will be billed the difference at the beginning of the next semester.
Proof of Acceptance Letter and SDS
When confirming your enrolment, you will need to indicate whether or not you are applying via SDS. This information is given to Student Accounts to generate an invoice for you. If you do not indicate SDS, you will not be invoiced and you will be counted as a non-SDS applicant. Errors will delay your ability to gather the documents required for your study permit application, so please pay attention when completing any forms or confirmations.
Payments
Once you have indicated SDS on your application, you will receive an invoice and payment instructions from Student Accounts Canada. You will need to pay the invoice in order to get the receipt required for your study permit application.
PLEASE NOTE THAT ONLY SDS ELIGIBLE STUDENTS WILL BE INVOICED IN ADVANCE. ALL OTHER STUDENTS WILL BE BILLED AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH SEMESTER BASED ON COURSE REGISTRATION. For non SDS students, paying your fees up front does not guarantee a higher likelihood of a positive decision on your study permit application.

Applying for a Social Insurance Number in Canada

A Social Insurance Number (SIN) is a 9-digit number that you need to work and be paid in Canada and access government programs and benefits. It is also used to file taxes.
(*If you are not eligible for a SIN, you can apply for an Individual Tax Number (ITN) for tax purposes.)
You are responsible for protecting your SIN. Ensure that you store documents containing your SIN and personal information in a safe place. For more information about protecting your SIN, please visit.
* International students get a SIN starting with the number ‘9,’ which lets employers know that you are a temporary resident in Canada.

How to apply for a SIN

You can apply for a SIN in person at a Service Canada Office. Your SIN will be issued the day you apply.
Document needed:

A valid original primary document to prove your identity and legal status in Canada. A primary document can be:

A Work Permit issued by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)
A Study Permit issued by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)

A valid original secondary document to confirm your identity. A secondary document can be:

A passport (Canadian or foreign)
A provincial or territorial ID card or driver’s license
Any other government-issued ID

Validity of your SIN

Expiry date of the SIN is based on the permit that authorizes you to work in Canada. Each time you extend your study or work permits and you want to continue working or file your taxes, you have to renew you SIN with the new or renewed permits.

Work Eligibility

A valid SIN alone does not automatically make you eligible to work on or off campus. You must still meet the eligibility requirements in order to legally work. Students in degree programs do not need a work permit to work off-campus.
Please visit the Student Services Advisor if you see “This permit does not permit the holder to engage in off-campus employment in Canada” under the condition section of your study permits.

Disclaimer: This is not a legal document and information may change without notice. Always refer to the government’s websites for the most updated information.

Novice drivers, or anyone who has never driven before, will need to take a driving test and gain experience before they receive a full license. There are several types of licenses in Ontario, but you need a G license to drive a car, minivan or small pick-up truck.
To learn the rules of the road in Canada, you’ll need to enroll in a driver-training program or review Ontario’s official road safety book. You can buy a copy of this book through Service Ontario. After studying it thoroughly, you can take the knowledge test.
Proof of driving experience
You can self-declare one year of driving experience, by showing a valid, original foreign driver’s licence. If you want to earn credit for more than one year of driving experience, you’ll also need an official letter from the foreign government or agency that issued the driver’s licence, confirming that the licence is authentic. This letter needs to be written in English or French.

Driving in Vancouver, BC

If you are a full-time student, you may use an International Driving Permit (IDP)  from your home country or you home driver’s license with an official English translation. You should also carry your passport, your study permit, and your Husky card.
Other new residents who plan to drive have 90 days after they move to British Columbia to get a BC driver’s license. If you wish to get a B.C. driver’s license, you may visit Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) website for more information.

Other Information

Seatbelts: Everyone in the car is required to wear a seatbelt, regardless of age, and car seats are required for children under 40 pounds.
Learn the signs: Signs, signals and road markings can be very different in Canada from your home country. Get familiar with them before you drive.
Follow the rules: Be aware of the speed limits and parking rules. The overall speed limit in Vancouver is 50 km/hr, and 30 km/hr in School/Park zones. Do not block a fire hydrangea, bus stop, driveway, or sidewalk.
Share the road: Yield to pedestrians and cyclists. Slow down, signal and pull over when you hear emergency vehicles (ambulance, firetrucks, and police cars) approaching.
Wild Animals: Human life comes first. Make your judgement based on the traffic condition and the size of the animals.
Cell phone use: Cellular devices must be used “hands-free” when driving.
Alcohol: Driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) is a serious offense in Canada and can result in a driving suspension, vehicle impounding, or arrest. For international students, serious offenses may lead to deportation.
Car-share: There are various car-share options such as Evo and Modo available in Vancouver. These car-sharing initiatives allow you to rent a car whenever you want.

These instructions are for students who are recent graduates or graduating soon from a Northeastern Canadian campus, who are planning to invite their family members to attend their graduation ceremony.

Purpose of Letters of Invitation

For visitors to Canada, letters of invitation can help to explain the purpose or a reason for a visit to Canada and describe the details about a planned trip.
For visitors that require a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) to visit Canada, it is a good idea to provide a letter of invitation to support the application.
It is also good practice to have a letter of invitation ready to provide to border officers at ports of entry upon arrival in Canada to help demonstrate purpose of entry. This applies to all visitors if someone is inviting them, including visitors from visa exempt countries.
A letter of invitation does not guarantee that Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will issue a visa or that Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) will allow entry into Canada. Visa officers assess the applications to decide whether the person invited meets the terms of Canada’s immigration laws. Similarly, border officers at ports of entry will consider all the relevant factors in accordance with Canada’s immigration laws, including purpose of entry in making the decision to allow entry.
Writing a letter of invitation does not mean you are legally responsible for the visitor once they enter Canada. You should still write the letter in good faith and you must tell the truth and adhere to any promises that you make in the letter.

Information to Include in an Invitation Letter

A letter of invitation should include the following information:

At the top left-hand corner of the letter, the letter should include the recipient’s details, whichever is applicable: “Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada,” “Embassy ofCanada-Immigration Section,” “Consulate of Canada-Immigration Section” or “CanadaBorder Services Agency.”
The letter should be addressed “To Whom it May Concern or “Immigration Officer.”
The letter should include the date it is written.
The letter should be signed.
As the person making the invitation, you should include the following information:

Full legal name as it appears on your passport and provide a copy of the biographical page.

Date of birth.

If you are working, your job title, and employer.

Your address, phone number, and contact details such as email address.

Relationship to the person that you are inviting. If relevant, provide proof of relationship such as a marriage certificate or birth certificate.

Describe your current immigration status in Canada and provide proof (e.g. copy of post-graduate work permit or study permit).

Describe the program you are studying or studied, the campus you are studying at or studied at, date of graduation, and mention any relevant dates of significant events, where the event will happen, and provide proof that the event will be happening.

Details about your family such as your spouse and dependents’ names and dates of birth.

If you are helping to financially support a trip or part of the trip, include proof of funds such as an up-to-date bank statement.

Information to include regarding the person you are inviting:

Full legal name as it appears on the person’s passport.
Date of birth.
Address and telephone number.
Purpose of the trip.
Planned duration of the trip including expected departure date.
Where the person will be staying and how the person will pay for the trip.

After you have written the invitation letter, you should share it with the person that you are inviting, and they can submit the letter with their application and/or have a copy prepared for when they are entering Canada.
You can find more information on the IRCC website about letters of invitation.
To help with this process, we have also created a PDF version of the information on this page: Letters of Invitation Instructions

Maintaining Student Status in Canada

As a study permit holder, there are a number of conditions you need to meet. If you don’t meet these conditions, you may lose your student status and study permit. You may also have to leave Canada.

As a study permit holder, you must:

be enrolled at a designated learning institution (DLI), unless you’re exempt
show you’re actively pursuing your studies, unless you’re exempt, by
being enrolled full-time or part-time during each academic semester (excluding regularly scheduled breaks)
making progress towards completing your program’s courses, and
not taking authorized leaves longer than 150 days  from your study program
tell IRCC any time you  change post-secondary schools
end your studies if you no longer meet the requirements of being a student, and
leave Canada when your permit expires

You may have other conditions listed on your study permit. You must follow these conditions, which could include:

the level of studies
if you’re allowed to work on or off campus as a student in Canada
if you need to report for medical procedures
if you’re allowed to travel within Canada, and
the date you must stop studying.

Assessment of Study Permit Conditions

IRCC Officers should exercise their best judgment and take into account all relevant factors when assessing a student’s compliance with their study permit conditions.
Enrollment at a DLI
A foreign national who applied for a study permit on or after June 1, 2014, must be enrolled in a DLI.
Actively pursuing studies
As of June 1, 2014, all study permit holders must actively pursue their course or program of study, while they are in Canada.

IRCC has announced a number of policy and process changes. Below is a summary of the changes that may impact our students.

Frequently Asked Questions »

Frequently Asked Questions

×

Can I study in a part-time course in Canada?

From an Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) perspective, at a minimum, students must have part-time status with their institution to be considered to be actively pursuing their studies. However, one of the eligibility requirements for Post Graduation Work Permit is the student must maintain full-time status in every academic session. Part-time course load may affect the student qualifying for for Post Graduation Work Permit.

How can I prove that I meet the study permit conditions?

IRCC might ask you to prove you’re meeting your conditions, as part of a random check or if they have reason to believe you’re not meeting them.
IRCC might ask you for the official documents from the university confirming:

your enrolment status
the reason for and start date of any leave you’ve taken
the date you withdrew from a school or study program
the date you were suspended or dismissed from a school or study program
the date you stopped studying at the school
official transcripts
references from people who know you
proof from a medical professional confirming the medical need for a leave from your study program
document confirming your school has closed and no longer offers your study program
any other document an officer finds relevant

What if I am academically dismissed or transferring to another institution, how this will affect my status?

Student must stop on/off-campus work if they stop full-time studying (including being dismissed from school).
Students engaging in post-secondary studies in Canada are authorized to change institutions or programs of study within the same institution, provided they are not limited from doing so by conditions imposed on their study permit.
However, to assess if a student who has changed institutions or programs of study a number of times should be considered to be actively pursuing their studies, the officer should consider the student’s reasons for the changes. In cases where multiple program or institutional changes do not appear to support the expectation that the student is making reasonable progress toward the completion of a Canadian credential, the officer may determine that the study permit holder has not fulfilled their study permit condition to actively pursue their course or program of study.
A student should begin or resume their studies at their new institution within 150 days from the day that they ceased or completed their studies at the previous institution. If a student does not resume their studies within 150 days, they should do either of the following:

change their status (that is, change to visitor status or worker status)
leave Canada

If they do not change their status or leave Canada, they are considered non-compliant with their study permit conditions.

What does “non-compliant” mean?

Non-compliance with study permit conditions may result in enforcement action; that is, an exclusion order can be issued for non-compliance, per Canadian Immigration Law.
Non-compliance with study permit conditions or engaging in unauthorized work or study may also negatively affect future applications that are made under the IRPA and IRPR. For example, a subsequent study permit or work permit may not be issued until a period of 6 months has passed, since the cessation of the unauthorized work or study or failure to comply with a condition, per Canadian Immigration Law section R221 and subsection R200(3).

What if I take a leave of absence from my studies, how will this affect my status?

Students may be required or may wish to take leave from their studies while in Canada. Office of Global Services Canada does not approve or authorize leave of absence. Students who wish to request leave of absence are strongly recommended to familiar themselves with the immigration implications with regard to taking the leave. For the purpose of assessing if a student is actively pursuing their studies, any leave taken from a program of studies in Canada should not exceed 150 days from the date the leave commenced and must be authorized by their DLI.
Examples of reasons for leave include but are not limited to the following:

medical illness or injury
pregnancy
family emergency
death or serious illness of a family member
change in program of study within the same institution, outside a regularly scheduled break
dismissals or suspensions (dependent on degree of severity)
postponed program start date (see Deferred enrollment for more information)

A student on leave who begins or resumes their studies within 150 days from the date the leave commenced (that is, the date the leave was granted by the institution) is considered to be actively pursuing studies during their leave. If a student does not resume their studies within 150 days, they should do either of the following:

change their status (that is, change to visitor status or worker status)
leave Canada

If they do not change their status or leave Canada, they are considered non-compliant with their study permit conditions.
Students studying at Northeastern University Canadian campuses are advised to work with their Academic Advisor if they wish to take the leave. They are also advised to keep a copy of any emails/confirmation regarding the authorized leaves that are granted, in case they need it for their PGWP application.

What is maintained status?

Maintained status (formerly called “implied status”) refers to a legal extension of an individual’s immigration status while waiting for IRCC to process an application for a new permit to remain in Canada. To have maintained status, you must submit your application to IRCC for a new permit before your current status expires.
For continuing students, this means that you may be able to continue to study (and work if eligible) beyond your study permit expiration date as long as you applied to extend your study permit before your previous permit expired.
Work on Campus

You can work on-campus as an international student without a Work Permit if you meet the three criteria below:

You have a valid study permit;
You are a full-time student at Northeastern University;
You have a Social Insurance Number (SIN)

You must stop working on-campus:

on the day you stop studying full-time
when your study permit expires
if you’re on an authorized leave from your studies
if you’re switching schools and aren’t currently studying

You can return to work only once you’re back to studying and you meet all the requirements to work on-campus.

Work off Campus

You can work off-campus as an international student without a Work Permit up to 20 hours per week or full-time during the scheduled school breaks if you meet the four criteria below:

You have a valid study permit that includes a condition stating you may work off campus;
You are a full-time student at Northeastern University;
You have a Social Insurance Number (SIN);
You need to have full time student status, before and after the scheduled break.

If you are a part time student
You can work off-campus only if:

You meet all the requirements above and
You’re only studying part-time, instead of full time, because:

You’re in the last semester of your program and you don’t need a full course load to complete your program and
You were a full-time student in your program in Canada, up until your last semester

Note: You can only start working on or off campus when you start your program. You can’t work before your studies begin.
Please also take a look at some information we’ve put together about the IRCC Temporary Public Policy Update released on Dec 7, 2023 about working off campus as an international student to see if you qualify.

Co-op Work

If work experience is a necessary and integral part of your program and you meet the college co-op program criteria, you may work full-time during their designated co-op term(s).  All NU programs are eligible for co-op.
During your co-op term you must be cleared by your college for co-op, register for the co-op course, and have a valid co-op permit in hand.

To check whether you may participate in the co-op program, please check your college website and/or contact your co-op coordinator.
To check how to apply for a co-op work permit, please visit here.
To request a co-op school letter, please contact your international student advisor or submit a request through the OGS Inquiry Form.

Frequently Asked Questions

Q. Will a part time status on my tax form affect my PGWP?

If the information on your tax form is incorrect, then that is an issue to resolve with SFS. If you were actually part-time during a term, then you may be required to explain this to IRCC on your PGWP application. If you were part-time during a regular academic term, then your eligibility for the PGWP may be affected.
IRCC and CRA do not share information except for two situations:

There is an investigation due to suspected fraud.
You have applied for Canadian citizenship and IRCC needs to verify your residency and tax status to support your Citizenship application.

Your PGWP eligibility will be assessed on your enrolment records with the Registrar’s Office and on the compliance report that we submit biannually to IRCC.

Q. How will co-op be shown on my transcript? Will this affect my PGWP application?

Your co-op will be indicated on your transcript in the appropriate term. If you believe that your transcript doesn’t properly represent what you were doing each term, then be sure to include a letter of explanation with your PGWP application. As an example, if you took a part-time course load while working on co-op, and your registration status for that term is showing as part-time, then include that information in your letter of explanation with your PGWP application.

Q. How are summer breaks shown on my letter of program completion or transcript?

If your program has a summer break, then this should be shown in the academic calendar for your program, or if you have a modified program, in your course or program map.  Studying part-time or full-time during a scheduled break in your program is fine, and will not affect your PGWP. Courses taken during breaks still need to be the majority on ground, as your program is assessed overall, including studies done during non-mandatory terms.

Q. Can I get a letter explaining my enrolment status and showing summer breaks?

You will receive a letter to verify that you have completed your program requirements, to support your PGWP. You will also need to obtain a transcript to submit with your PGWP application. If you have taken a part-time course load or an authorized leave or have another unique situation, you would need to explain and document this in a letter of explanation with your PGWP application.
The following processes apply to you if you have already started the program in Canada and wish to transfer between the two NU Canadian campuses or between Canada and US. For students who haven’t started the program yet, please see incoming students section below for further information.

Process for Transferring Between Canadian Campuses

1. Speak with your Academic Advisor
Different colleges may have different requirements and policies on campus transfer. Please speak with your current Academic Advisor to understand the requirement and policy of your college as well as make sure there will be courses available on your desired campus.
2. Request a Transfer
Please follow the instructions provided by your academic advisor to submit the request. More information and the Campus Transfer Request form can be found here.
3. Email OGS Canada
To ensure that you meet all the immigration expectations, send us an email: [email protected]. Please also attached the approved campus transfer form.
4. Notify IRCC of the DLI change
Both Northeastern University Toronto and Vancouver Campuses are Canadian Designated Learning Institutions (DLI) recognized by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship of Canada (IRCC).
Northeastern University Toronto Campus’ DLI number is O141550844262 (begins with the letter “O”).
Northeastern University Vancouver Campus’ DLI number is O142031583162 (begins with the letter “O”).
If you hold a valid study permit that has been issued to you based on your acceptance to a DLI but you will be transferring to another DLI, including transferring between the two NU Canadian campuses, you need to follow the instructions on the IRCC website and change the DLI number associated with your study permit.

5. Apply For a New Co-Op Work Permit
Since Co-op is an integral part of the education program, the co-op work permit is typically issued to allow students to participate in co-op program at a specific institution. Therefore, if you are transferring from another institution to a NU Canadian campus, you need to apply for a new co-op work permit to be able to do co-op at NU. This includes transferring between the two NU Canadian campuses. Your co-op work permit is not valid if it was issued for a different institution or different NU campus.
6. Register for Courses
Once your DLI number has been changed, you may work with your destination campus academic advisor to register in courses.

Process for Transferring from a US Campus to a Canadian Campus

1. Speak with your Academic Advisor
First, you will need to reach out to your current college/academic advisor to understand the requirements of the campus transfer and confirm course availability at the destination campus and seek academic approval.
2. Reach out to OGS Canada
Once you confirm that your campus transfer can be supported, reach out to the OGS Canada team to understand the process for applying for a study permit to study in Canada and eligibility for PGWP. Email OGS Canada: [email protected]
3. Submit Campus Transfer Request

Frequently Asked Questions

Legal Status After a Dismissal

As study permit holders, international students are required to stay enrolled at a DLI and actively pursue their program of study in Canada. Therefore, a student should begin or resume their studies at their new institution within 150 days from the day that they ceased their studies at Northeastern University Canadian campuses.  If a student is not able to resume the studies within 150 days with another eligible DLI, they should:

Change their status (that is, change to visitor status or worker status), OR
Leave Canada

If a student is not enrolled in their program, and do not change status or leave Canada within 150 days of ending their studies, they are considered non-compliant with the study permit conditions.

Work Eligibility After Dismissal

International students are no longer authorized to work on their study permit on/off campus in Canada after being dismissed from their study at Northeastern University Canadian campuses. Students who hold a valid co-op work permit may not undertake a co-op or internship placement after dismissal and may not use their co-op work permit to work on or off campus.

Non-Compliance

Non-compliance with study permit conditions may result in enforcement action; that is, an exclusion order can be issued for non-compliance, per subparagraph R228(1)(c)(v) in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations.

Non-compliance with study permit conditions or engaging in unauthorized work or study may also negatively affect future applications that are made under the IRPA and IRPR. For example, a subsequent study permit or work permit may not be issued until a period of 6 months has passed, since the cessation of the unauthorized work or study or failure to comply with a condition, per section R221 and subsection R200(3).

Academic Dismissal Appeal

Please note that even if you are in the process of appealing a decision of academic dismissal, the Legal status and Work eligibility requirements mentioned above still apply to you.

If you choose to leave Canada after being academically dismissed and wait for the decision outside of Canada, when the appeal is allowed, you can use your study permit and visa to come back to Canada to study provided they are still valid;
If you choose to stay in Canada after being dismissed and wait for the decision in Canada during the first 150 days after dismissal, you are not authorized to undertake any type of work in Canada. You may use your valid study permit to resume your study if you are re-admitted and if you resume the program in the first 150 days after dismissal, provided your study permit is still valid; if the study permit is about to expire when you resume your study, you must apply to extend your study permit before the expiry date;
If you choose to stay in Canada after being dismissed but you are not re-admitted resuming your study in the first 150 days after dismissal, you need to leave Canada or change your status to a visitor.

During scheduled breaks, students may choose to take the break or have part-time/ full-time course load if courses are available*.
*Students are advised to verify with their Academic Advisor that they will have enough on-ground courses available in the remainder of the program before choosing to take classes during scheduled break.

Dear Northeastern Students and Alumni,
Beginning on December 7, 2023, OGS deactivated its general office email addresses and implement a newly designed inquiry form in our self-service portal.
Effective immediately, students are encouraged to contact OGS through one of the below methods for
any inquiries or concerns:

1.  Submit a question online through our new inquiry form in the OGS self-service portal
2.  Call us over the phone (U.S.-based students) at +1-617-373-2310
3.  Visit us on the Boston Campus at 354 Richards Hall during regular office hours, or for walk-in
advising hours during the established hours
4.  For students currently studying at a Canadian campus, please email
[email protected] or check the links for drop-in advising hours or to make
an appointment:

Toronto: https://studentlifetoronto.sites.northeastern.edu/student-support-services/
Vancouver: Office of Global Services

As we outlined in an email announcement in late-September, OGS will no longer accept inbound emails to the general office email addresses mentioned below. Instead of emailing inquiries to
[email protected], or one of the other general office email addresses below, all questions should be submitted through the new inquiry form. This self-service portal aims to provide resources to students that will assist with answering frequently asked questions. If your question can’t be answered utilizing resources in the portal, you will be able to submit the inquiry form for review by the OGS team. This shift in communication method will allow students to receive answers to their questions as quickly as possible.
Effective immediately, the below email addresses will no longer be monitored:

[email protected], [email protected], [email protected],
[email protected], [email protected],
[email protected], [email protected],
[email protected], [email protected],
[email protected]

The following emails will remain the active for the following populations:

[email protected]: For all J-1 Scholars
[email protected]: For all current international students studying
in Toronto or Vancouver

Email, sent to OGS before today, will still receive a response and does not need to be resubmitted
through the inquiry form.
Tips for using the OGS self-service portal:

Always log in with your Northeastern credentials for a more personalized experience. This will
also lead to more accurate, timely responses.
Browse available knowledge articles in the portal for answers to frequently asked questions (and
check back often as new articles will continuously be added!)
Include as much information as possible when submitting an inquiry for the OGS team to best
advise you
Limit the number of inquiries you submit to OGS by including all your questions in the same
form
Check on your open inquiries (also known as cases) and provide any follow up information
through the “my cases” tab at the top of your portal rather than opening a new case

To access the OGS portal and to ask a question through the new inquiry form, please use this link:
https://service.northeastern.edu/ogs

As a reminder, this change will not impact other services provided by OGS, including the availability of
support via OGS’ main phone line for U.S.-based students or via visit to the Boston office in 354 Richards Hall.

We are looking forward to improving the services we offer to our international student population and
thank you in advance for your patience and flexibility throughout this transition.

Arrival
Travel Dates

(Updated 02/28/2024)

All F-1 and J-1 students are expected to arrive at Northeastern University by the program start date that is listed on their Form I-20/DS-2019 in order to appropriately abide by federal regulations. The program start dates on the Form I-20/DS-2019 are aligned with the Academic Calendar of the University. Plan on arriving by the first day of the program start date listed on your Form I-20/DS-2019.
Remember: Students can only enter the United States 30 days before the program start date listed on their Form I-20/DS-2019. Students who attempt to enter the U.S more than 30 days before their program start date may be found inadmissible by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Late Arrival
We recognize that some students may experience extenuating circumstances outside of their control, and that may delay their arrival by a few days. If you find out that you are unable to arrive for the first day of classes, you must notify your College contact. For your convenience, you may click here for a list of each College’s contacts.
*No late arrivals may be approved by your College beyond the University Add/Drop deadline.
Last Day of University Add/Drop – Spring 2024 (last day to add classes)

Graduate Spring Quarter 2024 Students
4/22/2024

*If your Form I-20/DS-2019 has not yet been issued by your program’s start date, you are not eligible for late arrival and you will be required to defer your program. Please find more information here.
If your College contact approves your late arrival request, you will receive a support letter in an email. A late arrival support letter does not guarantee entry to the U.S. as all students should be entering the U.S. by the program start date listed on their I-20/DS-2019.
Upon entry to the U.S., you must complete the Online Immigration Clearance check-in so OGS can activate your SEVIS record in a timely manner.
Students who may need to travel to the U.S. later than the Add/Drop deadline must work with their College to defer enrollment to the next academic term. Please find more information here.

Required Documents

Travel documents required for entry into the United States

Valid entry visa for study in the U.S. (in most cases an F-1 visa or J-1 visa)

Apply for an Expedited Visa Appointment within 60 days of program start date: This option is limited only to students and exchange students who are within 60 days of their start date, and who have not been previously refused a visa within the last six months. The process to request an expedited visa interview varies by location. You should refer to the instructions on the website of the Embassy or Consulate Visa Section where you will interview, or on their online appointment scheduling site. OGS is not able to provide letters nor is a letter required to request an expedited appointment if you’re eligible.

Visa supporting documents such as:

Form I-20 (F-1 students) or Form DS-2019 (J-1 students/scholars). Ensure that you have a valid travel signature on your document. Travel signatures can be requested here.

If your document is an Initial I-20 or DS-2019, you do not require a travel signature

Passport that is valid for at least six months after the intended entry into the US.

If you need assistance with your travel documents, please contact OGS.

Travel Steps

Apply for a visa

If you have recently applied for a F-1 or J-1 visa, submit the Visa Application Status form via myOGS. We do not recommend making travel plans until you have valid documents for travel.

Arrange your travel
Register your travel

Register your travel with the University’s Travel Registry
This is available via “MyTravelPlans” in the Student Hub or directly through the GardaWorld Travel Security Portal (sign in with your Northeastern email address).
More information on the Travel Registry can be found here and here.
Contact [email protected] for travel registry assistance.

Ensure that you have gathered and printed the following important paperwork and pack it in your carry-on luggage for easy access:

Original Form I-20 or DS-2019 (make sure you have signed it in the appropriate spot)
Acceptance Letter from Northeastern University
Proof of Funding (generally the financial documents you provided in your I-20/DS-2019 application) and/or a receipt of tuition payment (if available)
Proof of SEVIS Fee Payment (I-901 Fee Receipt)
Passport, valid for at least six months into the future from the date of your arrival
F-1/J-1 Visa Stamp (in your passport)

Research possible restrictions for the duration of your travel

Determine what is needed for you to comply with the relevant regulations for your travel (e.g. departure, connections, customs) according to your citizenship(s) and immigration documentation at each checkpoint.
Be aware of the specific exit requirements from your point of origin and the entry requirements at any transit points, as well as the point of entry in the United States.
Adhere to airlines’ COVID-19 safety requirements (if there are any).

If in doubt about any information, contact the relevant immigration or government authority of the countries of the travel.

After Landing in the U.S.

Primary Inspection
When you arrive at the U.S. Port of Entry, you will first go through Primary Inspection. This is where a Customs & Border Protection (CBP) officer will review your documents to determine if you may enter the U.S. They may also ask you some basic questions. Provide truthful answers and ask for clarification if needed. Here are some tips:

Be sure to tell the CBP officer that you will be studying at Northeastern University as an F-1 student, or a J-1 exchange visitor when you present your I-20 and F-1 visa or DS-2019 and J-1 visa.
You will be issued an electronic I-94, which indicates your nonimmigrant status in the U.S, which should be F-1 student status or J-1 exchange visitor status.
Currency: if you or the family members you are travelling carry currency amounting to more than $10,000, you must fill out an additional form to declare this. More information can be found here.
Food items: there are restrictions on certain food and agricultural items that are allowed into the US. Please reference the CBP website for more details

Generally, this step should not last more than a few minutes. Until recently, visa holders received an entry stamp in their passports, and the CBP officers noted D/S (Duration of Status) on F-1 and J-1 visa passport pages; this meant you are allowed to stay in the U.S. for the length of time indicated on your I-20 or DS-2019, provided that you maintain full-time enrollment and a valid F-1/J-1 visa status.
Many U.S. airports have discontinued stamping passports with an entry stamp when entering the U.S. Instead, each time you enter the U.S., the CBP creates an online, electronic entry record to record your entry into the U.S. This is called your I-94 record (Scroll down to read Check Your I-94 Record for more information).
If everything is in order, the CBP officer will return all of your documentation they inspected, and you can proceed to collect any checked luggage and/or transfer. Ensure that you have collected all of your belongings before exiting the immigration inspection area.
If the officer has additional questions, you may be directed to Secondary Inspection.
Secondary Inspection
Secondary Inspection (also called Deferred Inspection) allows a CBP officer more time to ask you additional questions and gather information to determine if you may be allowed entry. It is not a punishment and does not mean that you will be denied entry.
The officer may ask you additional questions or try to reach out to Northeastern to confirm your status. If additional information regarding your F-1 or J-1 status is needed, please request that the CBP officer calls the university to speak to a Designated School Official (DSO) for F-1 visa holders or Alternate Responsible Officer (ARO) for J-1 visa holders, using the following contact information (The operations center is staffed 24/7 for this purpose):

International Safety Office:

+1.617.373.2121 (NUPD)
[email protected]
This office is open even outside of normal business hours.
This office can best support you when you have registered your travel in advance so that they can easily access your travel details.

Office of Global Services:

+1.617.373.2310
Please see our Contact page for operations hours.

Most importantly, ensure that you cooperate with the officer as much as possible so as not to create further difficulties. More information on Secondary Inspection can be found here.

Check Your I-94 Record

The I-94 is an admission record that contains information about your most recent entry to the U.S. It is issued to all international travelers who enters the U.S. (with the exceptions of those who are part of a visa waiver program), and is updated with each entry you make. It contains your basic biographical information, as well as information about your visa status and how long you are allowed to remain in the U.S.
Once you have successfully cleared inspection and entered the US, you should retrieve your electronic I-94 record here. Note that it may take a few days after your entry for the record to populate. You should check and save a screenshot of your I-94 record each time you enter the U.S. as the I-94 is the only official evidence of your entry into the U.S.
Please review your I-94 record for accuracy. Two fields you may be unfamiliar with are “Class of Admission” and “Admit Until Date.” These fields should be filled out as follows:

Class of Admission: matches what is listed on your visa stamp
Admit Until Date: D/S (This stands for “Duration of Status”)

Visa status other than F-1/J-1 must be corrected immediately (B-1/B-2, WT, or WB status does not permit full-time study in the U.S.)
If anything looks incorrect on your I-94 record, please visit this page for more information on how to request a correction.

Form I-515 or I-515A

The CBP officer may issue you a Form I-515A if you are missing paperwork, or if they are not able to verify your status. This form allows you temporary entrance into the US for up to 30 days, during which time you must collect and submit the necessary evidence to the government to be able to remain in the US for the duration of your F-1 or J-1 status.
If you receive a Form I-515A, the Office of Global Services (OGS) is happy to provide guidance with your response to the government. Please complete the Request to Comply with I-515A e-form to notify us so that we may best assist.
Note that an I-515A should not have any negative impact on your status as long as you respond in a timely manner. More information on the form I-515A can be found here.

Departing the Airport

Car Service
A car service is great way to pre-arrange a convenient and safe ride from the airport to your final destination. OGS recommends Boston Carriage. Click here to visit their website and enter your reservation details. Use promo code HUSKY2020 for a 5% discount!
Tips for using Boston Carriage:

Book your ride in advance as soon as possible to guarantee that there is availability on your date of travel. You will receive detailed instructions about where to meet your driver upon your arrival.
Make sure to build in a 60-minute delay for clearing Customs & Border Protection and baggage claim after your flight arrival time.
Traveling with friends or family? Consider booking a van instead of a car so there is enough room for your luggage.
Expect “no-contact service” to decrease risk of COVID-19 transmission; this means all cars are outfitted with a partition between the driver and passenger area, the driver will be wearing a face mask, and vehicles will be sanitized before/after pick-up.

Ride-Share Apps (such as Uber or Lyft)

Download the app before you travel. You can log onto wifi at the airport to use the app and communicate with your driver.
Some airports, such as Boston-Logan, have a designated Ride App pick-up area. After collecting your luggage from baggage claim, follow signs and head to the appropriate spot before ordered the ride.
Always check that the license plate of the car matches the information in the app to make sure you are getting into the correct car.
Ask your driver to wear a mask and put down the windows for airflow to decrease risk of transmission of COVID-19.

Public Transportation
Depending on your final destination, public transportation can be a great way to get around your new city! Make sure to look up in advance directions to get from the airport to your destination. Many areas have a transportation app you can download before you arrive.

Traveling to Northeastern for Commencement

International students, who graduated in a previous academic term, but who want to participate in graduate ceremonies at a later date (for example, a student who graduates at the end of the fall academic term wants to participate in graduation ceremonies at the end of the spring academic term), will have a Completed SEVIS record if they did not apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT) or continue in a new academic program. This means that your F-1/J-1 visa and I-20/DS-2019 are no longer valid for entry to the U.S. (even if they have a future end date) as you are no longer enrolled in a program of study.

Do not request a travel signature since you are no longer eligible for this benefit.
Utilize alternate visas for travel to the U.S. such as a Visitor Visa or the Visa Waiver Program if you are a citizen of a participating country.

Purchase Comprehensive Health Insurance
UPDATED LINKS FOR FALL TO BE ADDED SOON!
All international students are required to purchase Guard Me insurance before coming to Canada to ensure that you have coverage from the day you arrive. Insurance is not included in your fees. Comprehensive health insurance like Guardme ensures that you get the major routine and emergency health services available to you, similar to the provincial health plans (OHIP or MSP).
Guardme is the mandatory health insurance for international students studying at a NU Canadian campus.

For Toronto Campus students: https://www.guard.me/neutoronto/department/new-students

If you are arriving before January 1st, there is an option to purchase Early Arrival insurance in addition to the New Student insurance here: https://www.guard.me/neutoronto/department/early-arrivals which will cover you prior to January 1st.

For Vancouver Campus students:

You need to purchase Guardme insurance for the first 90 days in Canada. Once you arrive in Canada, you can apply for the provincial health plan, MSP. All international students are eligible for MSP, only after 90 days in British Columbia.
For your first 90 days, you need to enrol for Guardme: https://www.guard.me/neuvancouver/department/apply-for-insurance/new-students

See here for more detailed information about health insurance in Canada.

Frequently Asked Questions

×
What is an I-20?

An I-20 is a U.S. immigration document issued by a university to certify that an F-1 student has met admission requirements and has proof of sufficient financial resources for his/her studies. An I-20 is required to apply for an F-1 student visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad.
Newly admitted international students that have paid a deposit should request an I-20. The Office of Global Services (OGS) encourages you to submit your initial I-20 request as soon as possible because the visa process takes time.

Who is an Initial student?

New international students coming from outside the U.S. that are seeking F-1 visa status.

Who is a Transfer Student?

If a student currently has an Active Student and Exchange Visitor System (SEVIS) record with another SEVP-certified institution in the U.S., they may be eligible to transfer their SEVIS record to Northeastern University. Transfer students must:

Request to have their SEVIS record transferred out from their current institution to Northeastern University
Apply for a Transfer I-20 from Northeastern University

Please see the Requesting your Transfer-In I-20 page for more information.

Who is a Change of Status student?

If you are currently in the U.S. in a non-immigrant status (B-1/B-2, F-1, F-2, H-1b or H-4) and would like to change to a different non-immigrant status (F-1, F-2, J-1 or J-2), you must apply for a Change of Status I-20. Once you’ve received the Change of Status I-20 there are two options:

Option 1: You may travel outside of the U.S., apply for a visa at a U.S. Embassy with all required materials, and re-enter the U.S. in the new status. This option is often referred to as Consular Processing.
Option 2: You may apply to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to change your status without leaving the U.S. by completing Form I-539 Application to extend/change your non-immigrant status. This process can take between 6 and 9 months and it is recommended you do not travel while your application is in process.

Please note: If your change of status application is approved by USCIS (option 2), your new F/J status will be active; however, you will not receive a corresponding visa in your passport that reflects the new status. As a result, you will need to apply for a new visa stamp at an embassy/consulate outside of the U.S. in order to re-enter the U.S. in F/J status.
To learn more about change of status and see which option is best for you, please schedule an appointment with an advisor at the Office of Global Services (OGS) by calling +1-617-373-2310.
Video: Change to F-1 Student Status
Video: Change to F-1 Student Status within the U.S.

TRAVELING WITH A PENDING CHANGE OF STATUS
We don’t recommend traveling outside of the U.S. while your application with USCIS is still pending. If you can’t avoid traveling, please consult with OGS beforehand as you may need to reach out to USCIS to withdraw your application prior to traveling and submit a new I-20 request with OGS.
CURRICULAR PRACTICAL TRAINING (CPT) AND OPTIONAL PRACTICAL TRAINING (OPT)
In order to be eligible for both CPT and OPT, you must have maintained full time enrollment with appropriate on-ground presence for at least one academic year. One academic year is defined as two semesters or three quarters. It may be possible for you to use your time in another status towards meeting the one academic year.
If you are a change of status student and have questions about CPT/OPT eligibility, please call OGS to schedule an appointment with an advisor by calling +1-617-373-2310.

What is a Change of Degree Level?

If you are a current, continuing student at Northeastern and you will be starting a new program at Northeastern, you must submit a Change of Degree Level e-form request to myOGS prior to starting the new program.
Please see the Guidelines on Maintaining Status page for more information.

Important disclaimer

The information on the Office of Global Services webpage is provided as guidance and is not intended to be legal tax advice. The Office of Global Services staff are not tax specialists and are NOT qualified to answer international students/scholars questions regarding taxes. If you believe you have a complicated tax issue, please consult the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, federal and state tax agencies, and tax professionals for advice and guidance regarding your individual tax situations.
The Office of Global Services has arranged access to Sprintax for you. Sprintax will guide you through the tax preparation process, arrange the necessary documents and check if you’re due a tax refund.
The code can be used for Federal taxes. If you have a state filing requirement, this will not be covered by the code and you must also mail this to the tax authorities. You are not required to use Sprintax and can use a different tax preparation software (or complete it on your own) if you prefer.
OGS also encourages students to utilize resources on Sprintax’s blog. You can use the search bar to seek information about the most frequently asked tax-related questions!

Sprintax Code

The Office of Global Services is providing Northeastern students with a unique code to cover the costs of filing a federal tax return and Form 8843 through Sprintax. These codes are limited and available on a first-come first-serve basis, so don’t put off your taxes to the last minute! The code was emailed out to all current students the first week of February – please check your junk/clutter folders in your email inbox if you do not remember receiving it. If you still cannot find it, please contact OGS through the OGS Service Portal and we will re-send it.

Understanding taxes

If you receive U.S. source income, including wages, stipend, or scholarship, you will likely have federal and state tax withheld from your checks.
U.S. taxes is a pay-as-you go system in that there may be automatic tax withholdings from your paycheck, stipend, or financial aid. This means that in some instances your available income will be reduced by the tax withholdings. When you file your annual tax report in April of each year, you will calculate the exact amount of tax due. (Some years you may get a refund and in others you may owe additional taxes.)

Who must file tax forms for 2024 tax season?
Even if you did not earn any income, if you were physically in the US on F or J status anytime between January 1st – December 31st 2023, you’re obligated to file a Form 8843 with the IRS (the Internal Revenue Service, or ‘IRS’, are the US tax authorities).
Meanwhile, if you earned any taxable US source income, you may need to file a federal tax return with the IRS. Depending on your individual circumstances, you may also need to file a state tax return(s).
Tax Filing Deadline:
April 15, 2024 is the last day for residents and nonresidents who earned US income to file Federal tax returns for the 2023 tax year.
Who is considered Resident or Nonresident for Federal Tax Purposes:
Generally, most international students & scholars who are on F, J, M or Q visas are considered nonresidents for tax purposes. International students on J-1 & F-1 visas are automatically considered nonresident for their first five calendar years in the US, whilst Scholars/Researchers on J visas are automatically considered nonresidents for two out of the last six calendar years in the US.
If you’ve been in the US for longer than the five or two year periods, the Substantial Presence Test will determine your tax residency.

Step by Step guide on How to File Your Nonresident Tax Forms (F and J)
1)  Gather the documents you may need for Sprintax

Document
Description

Passport

Visa/Immigration information, including
form I-20 (F status) or form DS-2019 (J status)

Social Security or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (if you have one)
This is not needed if you had no income and the 8843   is the only form you have to file.

W-2
This form reports your wage earnings if you worked.
If you had more than one employer you should get a W-2 from each employer. It is issued by the  end of January for the previous year. Make sure all employers from last year have an up-to-date  address for you.

1042-S
This form is used to report:

1.  Stipend, scholarship, fellowship income and travel grants (not tuition reduction or exemption)
2.  Income covered by a tax treaty
3.  Payment for other types of services (eg by the  semester as a note-taker)
If you received this type of income, the 1042-S will be e mailed to you by 15 March by the payer.
Note: Only Nonresident Aliens receive this form. If your tax status changes to a Resident Alien you will not get a 1042-S. Login to Sprintax to check your tax status if you’re not sure.

US entry and exit dates for current and past visits to the US
In addition to passport stamps, you can review or print your US travel history here

1099
This form reports miscellaneous income. Can be interest on bank accounts, stocks, bonds, dividends, earning through freelance employment

1098-T
This form is NOT needed and can NOT be used for a nonresident tax return because NRAs are not eligible  to claim education expense tax credits.

2)   Follow the Sprintax instructions
If you did not earn any US Income: Sprintax will generate a completed Form 8843 for you and each of your dependents (if you have any).
If you did earn US Income: Sprintax will generate your “tax return documents”, including form 1040NR, depending on your circumstances.
3)   If required, complete your state tax return
After you finish your federal return, Sprintax will inform you if you need to complete a state tax return. If so, you will have the option to use Sprintax for an additional fee. However, it is your choice to use them or to do the state tax return on your own.
4)   Read the instructions for filing/mailing your returns
Remember to read the instructions that Sprintax provides.
You will be required to download, print and sign your federal tax return and mail it  to the IRS. Depending on your circumstances, you may be able to E-file your Federal tax return. However, this will depend on certain eligibility criteria. You can learn more about eligibility in this Sprintax blog – https://blog.sprintax.com/nonresident-federal-tax-efiling-live/
If you have a state filing requirement, you must also mail this to the tax authorities.
Finally, if you only need to file Form 8843, this will also need to be mailed to the IRS.
DISCLAIMER: The Office of Global Services and Northeastern are NOT permitted to assist any student/scholar with any IRS tax form preparation or tax related questions. The information provided is intended for your benefit. Any questions or concerns should be directed to Sprintax, a certified tax preparer or a local IRS field office.

State and local tax

Some students and scholars must also file a state and/or municipal (local) tax form. For more information, please refer to the respective State Department of Revenue (e.g. Massachusetts Department of Revenue FAQ site)
Sprintax will help determine your State residence status. If you used the software to prepare your federal tax return it will prepare the forms you will need to file, if it is required
NOTE: You may be required to file a state tax return for each state you lived or worked during the preceding calendar year.

Do I need to file taxes?

YES! You must file federal tax returns if you were in the U.S. for any period of time during the previous calendar year.
If you receive income in the U.S., including wages, stipend, or scholarship funds, you will likely have federal and state tax withheld from your checks.

Form 8843: Whether or not you earned income in the U.S. in the previous calendar year, you must file at least the USA federal tax Form 8843
Form W-2: If you are employed by Northeastern University and/or any U.S. employer you should have received Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement that summarizes your previous year’s income and taxes withheld. W-2 documents are sent by the end of January. If you have worked for compensation and not yet received your W-2, please contact your Human Resources department. (The Office of Global Services does not have access to these forms)
Form 1040(s): It is the main form when filing taxes and reporting income. (Please, be aware that there are several versions of this form, consult you tax advisor for further information)
Form 1042-S: It details your benefits if it applies under a tax treaty between the U.S. and your home country

NOTE: This is not a complete list of tax forms. For more information consult your tax advisor.

What is a Social Security Number?

A Social Security Number (SSN) is a 9-digit employee identification number issued by the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA). Eligibility for an SSN is based upon a person’s eligibility to work in the United States. Those eligible for a Social Security Number include U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and qualified foreign nationals — including, in certain circumstances, students in F-1 or J-1 student status and J-1 scholars. An SSN is required by the U.S. government in some cases for tax and employment reporting purposes.
A Social Security Number Card is an important identifying document. Please make sure you keep it in a safe place to avoid identity theft. Do not carry your card with you. Keep it in a safe place with your other important papers!
To learn more about what a Social Security Number is please visit the Social Security website.
Remember: Social Security Numbers are not valid forms of work authorization! Please read the employment section to learn about student and exchange visitor work authorization on and off campus.

When can I apply for a Social Security Number?

F-1 Students

The SSA recommends that you wait at least 10 business days after your SEVIS record is registered at the start of your program, so that your status is updated in all relevant government databases, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) database that the SSA checks as part of your application.
If you have Curricular Practical Training Authorization, you can apply 30 days before the start date of your Curricular Practical Training
If you have Optional Practical Training Authorization, you can apply after you have both your I-20 with Optional Practical Training endorsement and your Employment Authorization card
If you are working on campus, you can apply after you receive your On-Campus Employment Letter from the Office of Global Services, but no earlier than 30 days before the start date of your on-campus job.

J-1 Students

The SSA recommends that you wait at least 10 business days after your SEVIS record is validated at the start of your program, so that your status is updated in all relevant government databases, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) database that the SSA checks as part of your application.
If you have Academic Training Authorization, you can apply 30 days before the start date of your Academic Training
If you are working on-campus, you can apply after your receive your On-Campus Employment Letter from the Office of Global Services
Please note: J-1 sponsored students who are not under Northeastern University’s J-1 Exchange Visitor Program must seek permission from their Program Sponsor to work on or off-campus.

J-1 Scholars

The SSA recommends that you wait at least 10 business days after your SEVIS record is validated at the start of your program, so that your status is updated in all relevant government databases, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) database that the SSA checks as part of your application.
After this, if you are receiving a U.S. salary, you should apply for the SSN as soon as possible. If you are not receiving a U.S. salary, you’re not required to apply for an SSN but can do so at any time during your program after this 10 business day window.

What documents do I need?

Please note that X equals document is required.

Where do I apply?

After collecting all required documentation, you can apply for your Social Security Number with the Social Security Administration. The Social Security Administration has a few locations in the Boston area. When applying for your Social Security Number, you will need to go in person to one of the Social Security Administration locations.
Generally, there are three convenient locations for Northeastern students studying at the Boston campus:

Social Security Administration
10 Causeway Street
Boston, MA 02222
Social Security Administration
10 Fawcett Street
Cambridge, MA 02138
Social Security Administration
10 Malcolm X Blvd.
Roxbury, Ma 02119

For Northeastern students studying at the Seattle campus:

Social Security Administration
Suite 901
915 2nd Ave, Seattle, WA 98174

If you are not located in Boston or Seattle, you can find the nearest Social Security Office near you here.

How do I apply for a Social Security Number?

BOSTON CAMPUS ONLY
The Social Security Administration (SSA) no longer requires appointments in order to visit an office, and has reverted to the pre-pandemic process of accepting applicants on a walk-in basis.  This means you should no longer mail or fax in documents.
Additionally, the SSA has launched a new online portal: OSSNAP – Online Social Security Number Application Portal allows you to enter your personal information prior to your visit to the SSA, so that when you go to the office, the SSA representative will only need to verify your information and check your documents.
OGS strongly encourages students to complete the online application prior to visiting the SSA office in person.  It will save time and speed up the process for you.
Please note that the SSA is only able to process your SSN application up to 30 days prior to your employment start date.
How do I apply for a Social Security Number (SSN)?

First, you will need to gain proper documentation from OGS by obtaining one of the following documents:

An on-campus employment letter (if you have obtained an on-campus job)

F-1 On-Campus Employment Authorization Letter Request
J-1 On-Campus Employment Authorization Letter Request

A Stipended Graduate Assistantship (SGA) letter (if you have received an SGA from your department)

SGA Social Security Number Letter Request

An I-20 with CPT authorization on the second page (if you have a co-op/internship/etc.)

CPT Authorization Request

The SSA office will not be able to process your SSN application if you do not have the proper documentation from OGS.

Visit OSSNAP – Online Social Security Number Application Portal and start your SSN application by answering the questions online.
After completing the online application, note down the confirmation number. You must take the confirmation number and visit one of the SSA offices (ideally one closest to your residential address) within 45 days, but not more than 30 days before your employment start date.

Please keep in mind that masks are still required inside all SSA offices.
For all other campuses, please continue to contact your local SSA office to understand their process. We will continue to update our website as more information becomes available.

How long does it take to get a Social Security Number?

It takes about two to four weeks for an Social Security Number card to be issued. You are allowed to start working with just a letter/receipt from the Social Security Administration (SSA) stating you have applied for a Social Security Number. However, this is at the discretion of your employer. Typically, if an employer will be doing a background check they will only accept a Social Security Number before you can start working. Please talk with the Human Resources Department of your employer about their policy.
Remember! Social Security numbers are not valid forms of work authorization! Please read the employment section to learn about student and exchange visitor employment on and off campus.
If you receive a notice from the SSA stating that they cannot issue you an SSN because “the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is unable to verify the immigrant document you submitted as evidence of your lawful visa status,” please contact OGS for further assistance.

ABOUT THE PROGRAM

The mission of the Office of Global Services’ Global Student Mentor Program is to:

Support incoming international students as they transition to college life at Northeastern and American culture
Foster engagement with the Northeastern community
Improve resource awareness and utilization

A peer mentor is a current student who spends time with new students to help them adjust to college life. Both international and domestic students can apply to be peer mentors. The students who receive mentorship are called “mentees.”

Participating new students will be matched with an OGS Global Student Mentor. The mentor will reach out first via Qooper to introduce themselves and set up the first meeting. Throughout the academic term, mentees will connect with their mentor in person through 1-1 meetings, small group sessions, and group gatherings. 1-1 and small group meetings take place in-person at least once per month. Mentees can ask questions and receive advice from the perspective of an experienced Northeastern student. Mentors will help their mentees set goals and make steps toward completing these goals throughout the first semester at Northeastern. Mentees might consider discussing with their mentors:

How to access resources on campus
How to join a club or get involved with the campus community
Suggestions for developing college-level study skills
How to use public transportation in Boston
Questions about American culture
Feelings of homesickness

Within the GSM Program, students will have the opportunity to build community in various forms:

Small Group Sessions
At least 2 GSM Meetups per semester
Affinity Groups
Mentee Resource Groups

Small Group sessions are led by a Global Student Mentor and are designed to introduce parts of the curriculum while providing a more intentional space for community development.
GSM Meetups are a great opportunity to meet people from all over the world with a shared experience- a first semester graduate student at Northeastern.
Affinity groups are identity based groups designed to connect students to campus resources for long term support and resources.  The GSM Program only supports students in their first semester, so this is a great way to get connected to the broader campus community.  Currently, the Affinity Groups include:

First Generation
Women
LatinX

Mentee Resource Groups are groups designed to connect mentees based on their shared interests.  We currently offer five MRGs including:

Health and Wellness
Travel and Explore
Skills and Budgeting
Career and Learning
Hobbies and Interests

It is important that mentees make the same level of commitment as their mentor. This includes being responsive to your mentor and making time in your schedule for regular meetings throughout the whole semester.
Northeastern has many different mentorship programs, so please review other options to find which program best supports your interest and needs. The OGS program is dedicated to supporting international students in their cultural transition and academic success. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that your mentor will be a student in your same academic program. If you are interested in peer support specific to your academic program, please consult with your academic advisor to see what may be available. Although there are resources for career or workplace networking, this is not the goal of this program.
