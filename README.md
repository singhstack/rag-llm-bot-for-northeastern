The "RAG Chatbot for Northeastern OGS and SEO (Student Employment Office)" project aims to develop an intelligent chatbot system to assist Northeastern University students with visa-related and student employment queries. Leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, the chatbot integrates a retrieval component with a generative language model to provide accurate and informative responses. The project involves scraping FAQ sections from Northeastern's website, storing data in a vector database, and utilizing large language models for response generation. Evaluation methods such as ROUGE and BLEU scores are employed to assess response quality.


Here is a quick demo of the chatbot:
